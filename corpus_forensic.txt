Abstract† 
This document describes the testing of dd in the FreeBSD environment. The test cases 
that were applied are described in Disk Imaging Tool Specification, Version 3.1.6. 
 
The tests were run on test systems in the Computer Forensics Tool Testing Lab at the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology. A variety of hard drives were used for 
the tests. The source disks (the ones that are copied from) were setup with FAT16, 
FAT32, NTFS or Linux EXT2 type partitions to represent the most common partition 
types. 
 
The main objective of this document is to provide enough information about the testing 
process for either an independent evaluation of the process or independent replication of 
the results. The intended audience for this document should be familiar with the MS-DOS 
operating system, computer operation, computer hardware components such as hard 
drives, hard drive interfaces (e.g., IDE or SCSI) and computer forensics.

1 Introduction 
The objective of the Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project is to provide a 
measure of assurance that the tools used in computer forensics investigations produce 
accurate results. This is accomplished by developing specifications and test methods for 
computer forensics tools and then testing specific tools. The test results provide the 
information necessary for toolmakers to improve tools, for users to make informed 
choices about acquiring and using computer forensics tools, and for the legal community 
and others to understand the tool capabilities.  Our approach for testing computer forensic 
tools is based on well-recognized methodologies for conformance testing and quality 
testing. 
 
The CFTT is a joint project of the National Institute of Justice, the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), and other agencies, such as the Technical Support 
Working Group.  The entire computer forensics community helps develop the 
specifications and test methods by commenting on drafts as they are published on the 
NIST website http://www.cftt.nist.gov/. 
 
This document describes the procedures used for testing dd in the FreeBSD Version 4.4 
environment. The test cases that were applied are described in Disk Imaging Tool 
Specification, Version 3.1.6. The main objective of this document is to provide enough 
information about the testing process for either an independent evaluation of the process 
or independent replication of the results. An independent replication of the testing would 
require sufficient hardware and software resources to execute the test cases, this 
document, the dd test report, Disk Imaging Tool Specification, Version 3.1.6, the FS-TST 
1.0 software plus revised error simulation software. Since it is unlikely that the exact 
hardware used by NIST is present, adjustments and substitutions must be made to run the 
test cases.  
 
The intended audience for this document should be familiar with FreeBSD, the MS-DOS 
operating system, computer operation, computer hardware components such as hard 
drives, hard drive interfaces (e.g., IDE or SCSI) and computer forensics. 
1.1 Testing Overview 
Several items were assembled and prepared before the testing began including: 
computers to execute the tests, hard disk drives, removable media, support software (FS-
TST Version 1.0) and scripts to control the testing process. The support software, FS-
TST: Forensic Software Testing Support Tools, revised error simulation software, scripts 
and the documentation for the software is available from the web site: 
http://www.cftt.nist.gov. 
 
A subset of the hard drives was selected for initial setup as source drives for the test cases. 
The source drives were setup once and then used for multiple test cases. After all the 


FreeBSD Test Environment 
2 
May 6, 2004 
components were prepared, the test cases were run. All the test cases followed a similar 
execution plan of three steps. 
 
1. Prepare the destination drive. Specified values were written to each sector of the 
destination drive. If a partition was required, it was created and formatted. This step 
was executed in a DOS environment. 
2. Execute dd. This step was executed in a FreeBSD environment to create an image file 
and to restore the image to a destination. 
3. Measure the results. The accuracy and completeness of the copy was checked by a 
sector-by-sector comparison. The source drive was checked for any change by 
comparing a SHA-1 taken before the execution of dd with a SHA-1 taken after dd 
was executed. This step was executed in a DOS environment. 
 
For each test case, the commands that need to be executed were contained in a set of 
script files. Except for partition creation and formatting, the programs required to setup 
each test case and to measure the results are contained in the FS-TST package. 
 
1.2 Document Overview 
Section 2 describes the test hardware, hard disk drives used and system configurations for 
running the tests. The procedures for creation or setup of source disks, DOS boot floppies, 
Windows media drive are described in Section 3. The script files for each step are 
described in Section 4. Section 5 describes the execution procedures. 
 
2 Test Environment Support Software 
The tests were run at the CFTT lab at NIST. 
 
Support software, FS-TST Release 1.0, was developed to support the testing of disk 
imaging tools. FS-TST Release 1.0 can be obtained from the http://www.cftt.nist.gov web 
site. The support software serves three main functions: initialization of a disk to a known 
value [DISKWIPE], comparison of a source with a destination [DISKCMP, PARTCMP, 
and SECCMP], and detection of changes to a disk [DISKHASH and SECHASH]. All 
programs were written in ANSI C and compiled with the Borland C++ compiler version 
4.5. BADDISK and BADX13 were written in assembler language and compiled with 
Borland Turbo Assembler version 5.0. The csh scripts were executed using the version of 
csh provided with FreeBSD 4.4. 
 
 
3 Media Setup 
The test cases required several media components to be created before the test cases 
could be executed. The following items were created. 
 
1. Source hard disk drives for the test cases. 


FreeBSD Test Environment

2. A media hard drive with FreeBSD, scripts to execute dd and space to contain image 
files. 
3. A Windows 98 DOS boot floppy that contains control scripts, log files and creates the 
run-time environment for the test case setup and measurement. 
4. A CD that contains support software, and utility software. 
 
3.1 Source Disks 
There were too many possible disk layouts for all to be used in the tests. Five 
configurations were selected that covered the most common partition types. The first 
configuration was a dual boot Red Hat Linux 7.1 and Windows Me. This configuration 
also included FAT16, Linux EXT2, hidden partitions and deleted partitions (Table 3-1). 
The second configuration was a Windows 2000 system with both FAT32 and NTFS file 
systems (Table 3-2). The third configuration did not contain a valid partition table. The 
fourth configuration was a single FAT12 partition and the fifth configuration was a single 
FAT32 partition. All partitions were created with Partition Magic Pro 6.0.

The setup procedure for a source disk was as follows: 
 
1. Selected type of setup: Windows Me/Linux, Windows 2000 or none. 
2. Selected a hard drive 
3. Selected computer, installed drive, booted into PC DOS 6.3 from a boot floppy. 
4. Ran LOGSETUP to make a record of the setup. 
5. Ran DISKWIPE to initialize the drive contents. 
6. If the setup type uses an operating system the following two steps were completed  
7. Ran partition magic to partition the drive. For Windows Me/Linux source disk the 
script in Table 3-3 was used and for Windows 2000 source disk the script in Table 
3-4 was used. 
8. The installation instructions for each operating system were followed. For a Windows 
Me/Linux configuration, Windows Me was installed first then Linux. For a Windows 
2000 configuration, Windows 2000 was installed. 
9. Deleted files were created using a script (DOS batch file) that created a directory 
(X:\UDT, where X is a drive letter) with deleted files and a deleted subdirectory 
(Table 3-5). 
10. Ran DISKHASH to create a reference SHA-1 hash for the source disk.

3.2 Media Drive 
Several media drives were setup to contain the runtime environment for dd. 
 
1. A media drive was selected. 
2. The FreeBSD operating system was loaded to the drive. 
3. The /x directory was created to contain scripts, image files and log files. 
4. Test scripts were installed. 
3.3 Windows 98 Boot Floppy 
The Windows 98 boot floppy disk provided an execution environment for the support 
software and dd execution. The commands used to setup the floppy are presented in 
Table 3-8. The io.sys file on the boot floppy was scrubbed of any references to the C: 
drive and the following programs: DBLSPACE.BIN, DRVSPACE.BIN, and 
STACKER. 
 
In addition to the setup documented in Table 3-8 the files EN.EXE, BADX13.COM 
Version 3.2 and BADDISK.COM Version 3.2 are copied to the boot floppy.

In addition, the CD contained the following additional directories not used in testing: 
• NU: Contained some commercial utility programs. 
• Tools: Contained other DOS utility programs. 
4 Test Execution Scripts 
Each test case was executed in three parts: setup, tool execution and results measurement. 
The setup and measurement steps were executed as a series of DOS batch files (i.e., 
scripts) that guided the test operator through each phase of the test. The tool execution 
part was executed by csh scripts in the Linux environment. 
4.1 DOS Batch Files 
This section describes the DOS batch files used to setup a test case and measure the 
results. 
 
The START-IT.BAT script was used to start a test case. The script called the LOGCASE 
program to record information about the test case. The script also created simple scripts 
with parameters filled in so that the operator did not need to reenter information to 
execute the other required scripts. The simple scripts created by START-IT.BAT were 
DST.BAT (to execute XDST.BAT), CMP.BAT (to execute XCMP.BAT), HASH.BAT 
(to execute XHASH.BAT) and NOHASH.BAT (to execute XNOHASH.BAT). The 
simple scripts took a single parameter, hostname, to indicate the test computer used to 
execute the script.

4.2 csh Scripts 
This section describes the csh scripts that were used to execute the test cases. After 
FreeBSD was booted, the floppy drive was mounted to save the log files. This was 
accomplished by executing /x/mount-fd. After the floppy was mounted, then either 
dd_copy or dd_image was executed as required. The script dd_copy was used for cases 
that made a direct drive to drive copy; dd_image was used for cases that created an 
image file.

2. mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /x/fd 
3. dmesg | egrep '(MB)|(Copyright.*BSD)' | grep -v cd0 | tail -3 
 
 
The dd_copy script copied a source drive to a destination. The script used a block size of 
one sector (512 bytes). The script also loged any messages from dd and copied the logs 
to the floppy drive.

The script dd_image created an image of a source on the media drive and then restored 
the image to a destination drive. The image was created by the script dk-backup and the 
restore was done by the script dk-restore. After the restore was finished the script copied 
any log files to the floppy drive.

5 Test Case Execution Procedures 
This section presents the procedures used for running the test cases. It is assumed that the 
reader is familiar with basic computer operation. 
 
5.1 Computer Checkout Procedure 
Before any test cases were run, each test computer was checked for suitability as a test 
platform and the FS-TST Version 1.0 CD-ROM was installed. The procedure was as 
follows: 
 
1. A host computer was selected for check out. 
2. If the computer was on, the computer was shutdown and turned off  
3. Any hard drives were removed. 
4. The DOS boot floppy was inserted into the computer. 
5. The computer was turned on and booted to DOS. 
6. It was verified that the computer BIOS boot order specified boot to floppy drive 
before hard drive. 
7. If the boot or Power on Self Test (POST) failed, an attempt was made to diagnose the 
problem. If the problem could not be diagnosed and repaired, then the computer was 
not suitable for testing and was not used for testing. A computer that was not suitable 
for testing had a sticky label with the words DO NOT USE placed over the power 
switch to indicate that the computer should not be used. 
8. If the computer was available for testing, the FS-TST Version 1.0 CD-ROM was 
inserted. 
9. The computer was shutdown. 
 
 
5.2 Execution Procedure 
This section describes the generic test procedures used to test dd; slight deviations were 
required for some test cases. 
 


FreeBSD Test Environment 
14 
May 6, 2004 
1. A test case was selected to run. Test case selection is documented in Section 3 of Test 
Results for Disk Imaging Tools: dd in the FreeBSD environment, available at 
http://www.cftt.nist.gov. 
2. The required removable media was collected. 
3. The test computer and hard drives were selected. 
4. The destination drive was installed. 
5. The test computer was booted into DOS. 
6. The script START-IT.BAT was executed. 
7. The script DST.BAT was executed. 
8. The script PT.BAT was executed. 
9. If required, the excess sectors of the destination were hashed with SECHASH.EXE. 
10. The test computer was shut down. 
11. The destination drive was removed. 
12. The source, destination and media drives were installed in the test computer. 
13. The test computer was booted to FreeBSD on the media drive. 
14. The operator logged in as root. 
15. The command /x/mount-fd was executed. 
16. If the test case was a copy case the script /x/dd_copy was executed otherwise the 
script dd_image was executed to image the source to the media drive. 
17. The test computer was shut down. 
18. The media drive was removed. 
19. The test computer was booted to DOS. 
20. The CMP.BAT script was run for physical drive cases; the ACMP.BAT script was 
run for logical drive cases.  
21. If required, the excess sectors of the destination were hashed with SECHASH.EXE. 
22. The script HASH.BAT was run. 
23. The test computer was shutdown. 
24. The log files created on the floppy disk were copied to a permanent read only location 
subject to regular backup. 
5.3 Results Evaluation Procedure 
After a test case was run, the results were examined to determine if the results should be 
accepted or if some further actions were required to complete the test case. The 
evaluation of results determines if the apparent results are an accurate reflection of the 
tool under test. Either a successful or unsuccessful test outcome was reviewed to ensure 
that an error in the testing process had not occurred. 
 
The first issue was if a test appeared to be successful should we accept the result that the 
tool has produced the expected result for the particular test case? There are several ways 
that the test could appear to produce expected results without actually doing so. This 
would usually involve entire steps not running and the measurement of disks that are left 
in the final state of an earlier successful test. This was mitigated by always ensuring that 
the destination disk was wiped at the beginning of each test. The diskwipe log file was 
reviewed to verify that the correct number of sectors were wiped for the given destination 
disk. 
 


FreeBSD Test Environment 
15 
May 6, 2004 
The second issue was if a test appeared to be successful, should the result that the tool has 
produced the expected result for the particular test case be accepted? Each anomalous test 
run was reviewed to characterize the anomaly and then a course of action was selected. 
1. If a hardware or procedural problem was found, e.g., disk drive has failed, or 
improper configuration for the test, then the test was rerun with appropriate 
adjustments. 
2. If no hardware or procedural problem was found and the anomaly matched a known 
anomaly then the anomaly was accepted as genuine. 
3. If the anomaly was unique then a decision was deferred until more test cases were run. 
These test cases are referred to as defer until more. 
4. If the anomaly matched an anomaly in the defer until more category then both results 
were examined for common factors. If sufficient common factors were found, a new 
known anomaly was established, or the test cases remained defer until more. 
After all test cases were run any test cases remaining in the defer until more category 
would be resolved by either accepting the anomaly as genuine or reclassified based on 
additional investigation.

Introduction
About this International Standard
This International Standard provides guidelines that encapsulate idealized models for common 
investigation processes across various investigation scenarios. This includes processes from pre-incident 
preparation up to and including returning evidence for storage or dissemination, as well as general advice 
and caveats on processes and appropriate identification, collection, acquisition, preservation, analysis, 
interpretation, and presentation of evidence. A basic principle of digital investigations is repeatability, 
where a suitably skilled investigator has to be able to obtain the same result as another similarly skilled 
investigator, working under similar conditions. This principle is exceptionally important to any general 
investigation. Guidelines for many investigation processes have been provided to ensure that there is 
clarity and transparency in obtaining the produced result for each particular process. The motivation 
to provide guidelines for incident investigation principles and processes follows.
Established guidelines covering incident investigation principles and processes would expedite 
investigations because they would provide a common order of the events that an investigation entails. 
Using established guidelines allows smooth transition from one event to another during an investigation. 
Such guidelines would also allow proper training of inexperienced investigators. The guidelines, 
furthermore, aim to assure flexibility within an investigation due to the fact that many different types 
of digital investigations are possible. Harmonized incident investigation principles and processes are 
specified and indications are provided of how the investigation processes can be customized in different 
investigation scenarios.
A harmonized investigation process model is needed in criminal and civil prosecution settings, as well 
as in other environments, such as corporate breaches of information security and recovery of digital 
information from a defective storage device. The provided guidelines give succinct guidance on the 
exact process to be followed during any kind of digital investigation in such a way that, if challenged, no 
doubt should exist as to the adequacy of the investigation process followed during such an investigation.
Any digital investigation requires a high level of expertise. Those involved in the investigation have to be 
competent, proficient in the processes used, and they have to use validated processes (see ISO/IEC 27041) 
which are compatible with the relevant policies and/or laws in applicable jurisdictions.
Where the need arises to assign a process to a person, that person will take the responsibility for the 
process. Therefore, a strong correlation between a process responsibility and a person’s input will 
determine the exact investigation process required according to the harmonized investigation processes 
provided as guidelines in this International Standard.
This International Standard is structured by following a top-down approach. This means that the 
investigation principles and processes are first presented on a high (abstract) level before they are 
refined with more details. For example, a high-level overview of the investigation principles and 
processes are provided and presented in figures as “black boxes” at first, where after each of the high-
level processes are divided into more fine-grained (atomic) processes. Therefore, a less abstract and 
more detailed view of all the investigation principles and processes are presented near the end of this 
International Standard as shown in Figure 8.
This International Standard is intended to complement other standards and documents which provide 
guidance on the investigation of, and preparation to, investigate information security incidents. It 
is not an in-depth guide, but it is a guide that provides a rather wide overview of the entire incident 
investigation process. This guide also lays down certain fundamental principles which are intended 
to ensure that tools, techniques, and methods can be selected appropriately and shown to be fit for 
purpose should the need arise.

comprehensive guide, but lays down certain fundamental principles which are intended to ensure that tools, 
techniques, and methods can be selected appropriately and shown to be fit for purpose should the need arise.
This International Standard also intends to inform decision-makers that need to determine the 
reliability of digital evidence presented to them. It is applicable to organizations needing to protect, 
analyse, and present potential digital evidence. It is relevant to policy-making bodies that create and 
evaluate procedures relating to digital evidence, often as part of a larger body of evidence.
This International Standard describes part of a comprehensive investigative process which includes, but 
is not limited to, the following topic areas:
—	 incident management, including preparation and planning for investigations;
—	 handling of digital evidence;
—	 use of, and issues caused by, redaction;
—	 intrusion prevention and detection systems, including information which can be obtained from 
these systems;
—	 security of storage, including sanitization of storage;
—	 ensuring that investigative methods are fit for purpose;
—	 carrying out analysis and interpretation of digital evidence;
—	 understanding principles and processes of digital evidence investigations;
—	 security incident event management, including derivation of evidence from systems involved in 
security incident event management;
—	 relationship between electronic discovery and other investigative methods, as well as the use of 
electronic discovery techniques in other investigations;
—	 governance of investigations, including forensic investigations.
These topic areas are addressed, in part, by the following ISO/IEC standards.
—	 ISO/IEC 27037
This International Standard describes the means by which those involved in the early stages of 
an investigation, including initial response, can assure that sufficient potential digital evidence is 
captured to allow the investigation to proceed appropriately.
—	 ISO/IEC 27038
Some documents can contain information that must not be disclosed to some communities. Modified 
documents can be released to these communities after an appropriate processing of the original 
document. The process of removing information that is not to be disclosed is called “redaction”.
The digital redaction of documents is a relatively new area of document management practice, 
raising unique issues and potential risks. Where digital documents are redacted, removed 
information must not be recoverable. Hence, care needs to be taken so that redacted information 
is permanently removed from the digital document (e.g. it must not be simply hidden within non-
displayable portions of the document).
ISO/IEC  27038 specifies methods for digital redaction of digital documents. It also specifies 
requirements for software that can be used for redaction.
—	 ISO/IEC 27040
This International Standard provides detailed technical guidance on how organizations may define 
an appropriate level of risk mitigation by employing a well-proven and consistent approach to the

planning, design, documentation, and implementation of data storage security. Storage security 
applies to the protection (security) of information where it is stored and to the security of the 
information being transferred across the communication links associated with storage. Storage 
security includes the security of devices and media, the security of management activities related to 
the devices and media, the security of applications and services, and security relevant to end-users 
during the lifetime of devices and media and after end of use.
Security mechanisms like encryption and sanitization can affect one’s ability to investigate by 
introducing obfuscation mechanisms. They have to be considered prior to and during the conduct of 
an investigation. They can also be important in ensuring that storage of evidential material during 
and after an investigation is adequately prepared and secured.
—	 ISO/IEC 27041
It is important that methods and processes deployed during an investigation can be shown to be 
appropriate. This document provides guidance on how to provide assurance that methods and 
processes meet the requirements of the investigation and have been appropriately tested.
—	 ISO/IEC 27042
This International Standard describes how methods and processes to be used during an investigation 
can be designed and implemented in order to allow correct evaluation of potential digital evidence, 
interpretation of digital evidence, and effective reporting of findings.
The following ISO/IEC projects also address, in part, the topic areas identified above and can lead to the 
publication of relevant standards at some time after the publications of this International Standard.
—	 ISO/IEC 27035 (all parts)
This is a three-part standard that provides organizations with a structured and planned approach 
to the management of security incident management. It is composed of
—	 ISO/IEC 27035-1
—	 ISO/IEC 27035-2
—	 ISO/IEC 27035-3
—	 ISO/IEC 27044
—	 ISO/IEC 27050 (all parts)
—	 ISO/IEC 30121
This International Standard provides a framework for governing bodies of organizations (including 
owners, board members, directors, partners, senior executives, or similar) on the best way to 
prepare an organization for digital investigations before they occur. This International Standard 
applies to the development of strategic processes (and decisions) relating to the retention, 
availability, access, and cost effectiveness of digital evidence disclosure. This International Standard 
is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations. The International Standard is about the prudent 
strategic preparation for digital investigation of an organization. Forensic readiness assures that an 
organization has made the appropriate and relevant strategic preparation for accepting potential 
events of an evidential nature. Actions may occur as the result of inevitable security breaches, fraud, 
and reputation assertion. In every situation, information technology (IT) has to be strategically 
deployed to maximize the effectiveness of evidential availability, accessibility, and cost efficiency
Figure 1 shows typical activities surrounding an incident and its investigation. The numbers shown in 
this diagram (e.g. 27037) indicate the International Standards listed above and the shaded bars show 
where each is most likely to be directly applicable or has some influence over the investigative process 
(e.g. by setting policy or creating constraints). It is recommended, however, that all should be consulted 
prior to, and during, the planning and preparation phases. The process classes shown are defined fully

Information technology — Security techniques — Incident 
investigation principles and processes
1	 Scope
This International Standard provides guidelines based on idealized models for common incident 
investigation processes across various incident investigation scenarios involving digital evidence. This 
includes processes from pre-incident preparation through investigation closure, as well as any general 
advice and caveats on such processes. The guidelines describe processes and principles applicable to 
various kinds of investigations, including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, data corruption, 
system crashes, or corporate breaches of information security, as well as any other digital investigation.
In summary, this International Standard provides a general overview of all incident investigation 
principles and processes without prescribing particular details within each of the investigation 
principles and processes covered in this International Standard. Many other relevant International 
Standards, where referenced in this International Standard, provide more detailed content of specific 
investigation principles and processes.

5	 Digital investigations
5.1	 General principles
Digital investigations are in practice applied whenever it is needed to investigate digital evidence as a 
result of an incident, whether an incident is of criminal nature or not. There are many kinds of digital 
investigations, such as on desktop computers, laptops, servers, data repositories, handheld/mobile 
device investigations, investigations on live data (e.g. network and volatile data investigations), and 
investigations on digital appliances such as DVRs, game consoles, and control systems. The digital 
investigation process, however, is formulated in such a way that it is applicable to any kind of digital 
investigation.
5.2	 Legal principles
An overview is given of the legal requirements pertaining to digital investigations and especially the 
admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law. It should be noted that legal requirements may differ 
extensively in different jurisdictions across the world. The premise is not to advocate specific legal 
systems, but rather to note the generic requirements in terms of legal issues that can be adopted by 
the legal system of a specific jurisdiction. Depending on the particular laws in a particular jurisdiction, 
specific consideration and care should be taken when an accused is found to be innocent in a court of 
law. For example, due diligence and care should be taken to ensure
—	 safe deletion (see ISO/IEC 27040) of the evidence and case data at the end of the court case if so required,
—	 secure preservation of the media and devices holding the potential digital evidence as far as possible, 
secure preservation of the digital evidence itself and secure preservation of the investigation results 
for possible future reference, and
—	 notification to the subject of the investigation results.
In some jurisdictions it is acceptable that if scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will 
assist the court to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness accepted as an 
expert by virtue of their experience, knowledge, skill, training, or education, may testify thereto in the 
form of an opinion.[2] To help assure admissibility of expert opinion, the following factors should be 
considered (as applicable in the particular jurisdiction):
—	 whether the theories and techniques employed by the scientific expert have been tested;
—	 whether they have been subjected to peer review and publication;
—	 if an error rate for the technique is known it should be reported;
—	 whether they are subject to standards governing their application;
—	 whether the theories and techniques employed by the expert enjoy widespread acceptance.
NOTE	
The admissibility of the evidence itself and the admissibility of expert opinion about the interpretation 
of the evidence are two different issues to consider. For example, a technical witness may be able to testify about 
how evidence was acquired, preserved, etc., to address the adequacy of those processes without the necessity of 
qualifying as an expert. In other words, the expert may also testify to technical facts. Also see ISO/IEC 27042:—, 8.2.
Requirements for admissibility may vary considerably between jurisdictions and for that reason it is 
highly advisable to obtain competent legal advice regarding those specific requirements. However, 
many jurisdictions will include at least the following in their admissibility requirements for evidence:
—	 relevance — the evidence should have some relevance to the facts in dispute.
﻿
4
© ISO/IEC 2015 – All rights reserved


﻿
ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
—	 authenticity — the evidence should be shown to be what it purports to be. For example, if a particular 
JPEG image extracted from the hard drive of a particular server is relevant to a question of fact 
under dispute, the trier of fact will demand demonstrable assurance that the drive is in fact from 
that particular server, that it has not been modified in any way since its collection, that the process 
used to extract the JPEG image is trustworthy, etc.
It is important that legal issues need to be applied throughout the entire investigation process. For each 
and every sub-process, a legal check should be conducted in order to determine whether the legal laws 
and regulations are adhered to within the particular jurisdiction. It is recommended to seek legal advice 
within the particular jurisdiction in case of uncertainty.
6	 Digital investigation processes
6.1	 General overview of the processes
The digital investigation processes described in this International Standard are purposely designed 
at an abstract level so that they can be used for different digital investigations and different types of 
digital evidence. The use of this methodology is intended to aid the design and development of high-level 
processes with the intent to subsequently decompose them into atomic processes (see ISO/IEC 27041). 
Also, the processes aim to be comprehensive in that they represent a harmonization of all published 
digital processes by the time of writing this International Standard. The investigation processes are 
organized in a succinct fashion and describe how to follow these processes.
6.2	 Classes of digital investigation processes
The digital investigation processes constitute a long list. In order to abstract digital investigation 
processes at a higher level, they can be categorized into the following digital investigation process classes:
—	 readiness processes: That class of processes dealing with pre-incident investigation processes. This 
class deals with defining strategies which can be employed to ensure systems are in place, and that 
the staff involved in the investigative process are proficiently trained prior to dealing with an incident 
occurring. The readiness processes are optional to the rest of the digital investigation processes. The 
reason for this is explained in more detail in 7.1. Readiness processes include the following:
—	 scenario definition;
—	 identification of potential digital evidence sources;
—	 planning pre-incident gathering;
—	 storage and handling of data representing potential digital evidence;
—	 planning pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence;
—	 planning incident detection;
—	 defining system architecture;
—	 implementing system architecture;
—	 implementing pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing potential 
digital evidence;
—	 implementing pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence;
—	 implementing incident detection;
—	 assessment of implementation;

﻿
ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
—	 implementation of assessment results.
—	 initialization processes: That class of processes dealing with the initial commencement of the digital 
investigation. Initialization processes include the following:
—	 incident detection;
—	 first response;
—	 planning;
—	 preparation.
—	 acquisitive processes: That class of processes dealing with the physical investigation of a case where 
potential digital evidence is identified and handled. Acquisitive processes include the following:
—	 potential digital evidence identification;
—	 potential digital evidence acquisition;
—	 potential digital evidence transportation;
—	 potential digital evidence storage.
—	 investigative processes: That class of processes dealing with uncovering the potential digital 
evidence. Investigative processes include the following:
—	 potential digital evidence examination and analysis;
—	 digital evidence interpretation;
—	 reporting;
—	 presentation;
—	 investigation closure.
—	 concurrent processes: That class of processes that continues concurrently alongside the other 
processes. This class of processes differ from the previous classes in the sense that they happen 
in tandem with the other processes instead of linear. In addition, the particular order in which 
the concurrent processes execute is irrelevant as opposed to the other non-concurrent processes. 
Concurrent processes include the following:
—	 obtaining authorization;
—	 documentation;
—	 managing information flow;
—	 preserving chain of custody;
—	 preserving digital evidence;
—	 interaction with the physical investigation.
Figure 2 shows the relationships between the various classes of digital investigation processes.

ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
Figure 2 — The various classes of digital investigation processes
NOTE	
The dotted lines around processes in all figures indicate that the particular process is optional.
The six concurrent processes are aimed at allowing the said processes to be executed as on-going 
processes. The reason for having the concurrent processes is mainly to assure admissibility of digital 
evidence into a legal system, since, in the case of not having such processes, any investigation may 
run the risk that the admitted potential evidence might not be suitable for litigation due to improper 
handling, and documentation of potential digital evidence. These concurrent processes are, thus, based 
on principles that need to be followed throughout a digital investigation, alongside with the other classes 
of processes.
The digital investigation processes are multi-tiered, where each process would contain a set of sub-
processes. Sub-processes can only be fully defined for a specific type of incident and investigation. Legal 
rules will also likely have a high impact on the definition of sub-processes. These various classes of 
digital investigation processes are described in more detail in the clauses to follow, i.e. Clauses 7 to 11.
7	 Readiness processes
7.1	 Overview of the readiness processes
Readiness processes include that class of processes dealing with setting up an organization in such a 
way that, in the case that a digital investigation is required, such organization possesses the ability to 
maximize its potential to use digital evidence whilst minimizing the time and costs of an investigation. 
This class of processes is optional to the digital investigation processes since it is the prerogative of the 
organization to implement it rather than the task of the investigator(s).
There are four aims for having digital investigation readiness processes in organizations:
a)	 to maximize the potential use of digital evidence;
b)	 to minimize the costs of digital investigations incurred either directly onto the organization’s 
system, or related to the system’s services;
c)	
to minimize interference with and prevent interruption of the organization’s business processes;
d)	 to preserve or improve the current level of information security of systems within the organization.

Figure 3 depicts the readiness processes groups as described above, grouped in process groups as 
follows: planning processes group, implementation processes group, and the assessment processes group. 
The planning processes group includes readiness processes, as depicted in Figure 4, that are concerned 
with planning activities, including the
—	 scenario definition process,
—	 identification of potential digital evidence sources process,
—	 planning pre-incident gathering process,
—	 storage and handling of data representing potential digital evidence process,
—	 planning pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence process,
—	 planning incident detection process, and
—	 defining system architecture process.
Figure 3 — Readiness processes groups
The implementation processes group includes readiness processes, as depicted in Figure 4, that are 
concerned with implementing the planned activities in the planning processes group, including the
—	 implementing system architecture process,
—	 implementing pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing potential digital 
evidence process,
—	 implementing pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence process, and
—	 implementing incident detection process.
The assessment processes group includes readiness processes, as depicted in Figure 4, that are concerned 
with the assessment of the implementation success from the implementation process group, including the
—	 assessment of implementation process, and
—	 implementation of assessment results process.

ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
Note that the implementing incident detection process links to the incident detection process as shown 
in Figure 8 in order to establish the link from the readiness processes group to the initialisation 
processes group.
Input to all processes in Figure 4 includes all information regarding system architecture, technology 
(hardware and software), policies, procedures, and business processes of an organization where 
applicable. The input should also consider the four aims for the readiness processes as mentioned 
earlier. The input arising from the mentioned four aims are referred to as pre-known system inputs in 
the remainder of this International Standard.
The readiness processes are iterative, which implies that, after the last process, one can return to previous 
readiness processes, as shown in Figure 4. For example, when, during the assessment of implementation 
process, one notes that certain defined system architecture has not been properly implemented, one 
would need to go back to the implementing system architecture process. Another example is if one notes 
that plans made during the planning pre-incident gathering, storage and handling of data representing 
potential digital evidence process are not in line with aims for having digital investigation readiness 
processes in the particular organization, one could go back to the planning pre-incident gathering, 
storage, and handling of data representing potential digital evidence process in order to change those 
plans accordingly.
Each of the readiness processes are explained in the clauses that follow.
7.2 Scenario definition process
In this process, one should examine all probable scenarios where digital evidence might be required. 
The output of this process includes the defined scenarios.
It is also recommended that a proper risk assessment is performed during this process for each 
identified scenario respectively. A risk assessment would enable one to better identify possible threats, 
vulnerabilities and related scenarios that would expose particular information assets. Based on the 
assessed risk from certain threats, vulnerabilities or scenarios, one can, in later processes, better decide 
on the required controls to achieve investigation readiness within an organization. This will enable an 
organization to take into account the risk level, costs, and benefits of possible controls in a bid to reduce 
the identified risk.
7.3 Identification of potential digital evidence sources process
In this process, one should identify potential sources of digital evidence within an organization. The 
output of this process is the defined potential sources of digital evidence.
Some of the identified potential sources might not be available. For example, if access logs are not 
introduced within the system, it means that access logs will not be available as a source of data in the case 
of a digital investigation. In that case, controls should be explored to make the identified source available.

7.4	 Planning pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing 
potential digital evidence process
In this process, one should define activities for pre-incident gathering, storage and handling of data 
representing potential digital evidence. The output of this process includes the defined activities for 
pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing potential digital evidence.
The gathering period of certain types of data, is to be determined based on a risk assessment. The 
gathering, storage, and handling of data also have to conform to digital investigation principles in 
order for digital evidence to be admissible in a court of law. Lastly, the retention period of data is to be 
determined based on following factors:
—	 risk assessment;
—	 previous experience regarding incident detection, data quantities, network capacity, and all other 
matters that could influence cost or efficiency of this process;
—	 laws within the particular jurisdiction;
—	 regulations;
—	 business-specific requirements.
7.5	 Planning pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence process
In this process, one should define procedures for pre-incident analysis of data representing potential 
digital evidence.
The input to this process includes the scenarios as defined in the scenario definition process as well 
as the output from the pre-incident gathering process. The input should also include the aims for the 
readiness processes.
The output of this process includes the defined activities for pre-incident analysis of the data that 
represent potential digital evidence. The aim of this analysis is to detect an incident. Therefore, 
activities defined in this process should include exact information on how the incident is detected and 
what behaviour constitutes an incident.
As the task of data analysis and incident detection is often outside the scope of the functionalities of 
targeted information systems, it is recommended that this process defines an interface between the 
readiness processes and a monitoring system, which would analyse data in order to detect incidents. 
The monitoring system can be any system that is specialized for this purpose. It can also be any one 
of the following systems: intrusion prevention systems, intrusion detection systems, change tracking 
systems, log processing systems, etc.
7.6	 Planning incident detection process
In this process, one should define actions to be performed when an incident is detected. The output 
of this process includes defined actions to be performed once an incident is detected, in particular 
information to be passed on to the rest of digital investigation process. Information should also include 
pre-known system inputs, results from all of the readiness class processes, as well as data gathered and 
generated during the implementation process group processes.
7.7 Defining system architecture process
In this process, one should define information system architecture for the organization, while taking 
into account the output results of all previous readiness processes. The information system architecture 
in this context refer to the organizational structure of an information system, including necessary 
application systems, computer equipment, a communications network, and related software.

ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
Input to this process is the result from all previous readiness processes. The input should also include 
the aims for the readiness processes.
The output of this process is the defined system architecture for the organization. The aim is to customize 
system architecture, with specific reference to electronic storage and transportation of data and/or 
information within the architecture, to accommodate the accomplishment of the aims of the readiness 
processes. The main aim of this process is to identify potential data and/or information sources within 
the system architecture.
7.8	 Implementing system architecture process
In this process, one should implement the system architecture as defined in the defining system 
architecture process. The output of this process is the implemented system architecture.
Examples of implementing system architecture include the installation of new software, hardware, 
and/or policies which will permit the remainder of the readiness processes to be instantiated across the 
information system and the organization.
7.9	 Implementing pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing 
potential digital evidence process
In this process, one should implement pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing 
potential digital evidence, as defined in the planning pre-incident gathering, storage, and handling of 
data representing potential digital evidence process. The output of this process is the implemented pre-
incident gathering, storage, and handling of data representing potential digital evidence.
Examples of pre-incident gathering, storage and handling of data representing potential digital evidence 
include the implementation of logging software and hardware, with time stamping and digital signature 
mechanisms in place, or the implementation of customized software to gather the data of importance 
(i.e. system usage data).
7.10	Implementing pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital 
evidence process
In this process, one should implement pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital 
evidence, as defined in the planning pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence 
process. The output of this process is the implemented pre-incident analysis of data representing 
potential digital evidence.
Examples of pre-incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence include the implementation of 
change-tracking software such as a file integrity checker, intrusion detection/prevention software and/or 
anti-virus software. As the output of this process is delivered in the form of detected incidents, this links to 
the input of the incident detection process of the digital investigation processes as listed in Figure 4.
7.11	Implementing incident detection process
In this process, one should implement the actions defined in the planning incident detection process. The 
implementation of incident detection depends also on and receives input from the implementing pre-
incident analysis of data representing potential digital evidence process, as detection occurs based on the 
analysis performed.
During the implementing incident detection process, detection of an incident occurs according to the 
rules defined during planning incident detection process. Also, during the implementing incident detection 
process, one should decide on which data about the incident should be passed on to the rest of digital 
investigation process.
Examples of incident detection can be if change tracking software detects changes in a certain archived 
log or if an intrusion is detected via intrusion detection system.

Requirements for an event to be declared an incident requiring digital investigation would depend on 
policies of organization and cannot be prescribed by this International Standard.
This process represents an interface to the rest of the digital investigation process. This process is an 
overlap between readiness processes and an investigation itself. The reason for overlap is that the digital 
investigation cannot start until there is an incident detected.
7.12	Assessment of implementation process
In the assessment of implementation process, one performs an assessment of the results of the 
implementation process group and compares these to the aims for achieving digital investigation 
readiness. The output of this process is the results of the assessment of implementing digital investigation 
readiness for an information system. It is recommended that, at this process, a legal review is carried out 
for all procedures, controls, and architectures defined previously. The revision should show, amongst 
other, whether there is conformity with the legal environment and digital forensics principles of the 
particular jurisdiction, in order to assure admissibility of potential digital evidence in court.
7.13	Implementation of assessment results process
This process is concerned with the implementation of the conclusions from previous process. This 
process is optional, as it is possible that no changes are needed, based on the assessment of implementation 
process. Note that in Figure 4, this process is marked as optional and indicated as such with a dashed 
line around the process.
During this process, one should decide on recommendations for changes in one or more of the 
previous processes. The main decision here is whether to go back to one of the planning processes in 
the planning processes group of the readiness class of processes or to go back to one of the processes in 
the implementation process group, depending on the conclusions of the assessment of implementation 
process. For example, one might conclude that the implementation of a certain measure (e.g. that during 
implementing system architecture, one has not properly implemented log-in authorization controls 
planned during the defining system architecture process) was not performed in an optimal manner or 
one might decide that new implementation as to be performed.
8	 Initialization processes
8.1	 Overview of initialization processes
The initialization processes class consists of processes that initialize the digital investigation by 
handling the first response of an incident and planning as well as preparing for the remainder of the 
incident investigation process. Figure 5 depicts the initialisation processes, including the
—	 incident detection process
—	 first response process
—	 planning process, and
—	 preparation process.
The concurrent processes in Figures 5, 6, and 7 are given for illustrative purposes and a detailed 
explanation of the concurrent processes will be discussed in Clause 11.

ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
Figure 5 — Initialization processes
8.2	 Incident detection process
Incident detection procedures should be in place prior to the beginning of this process. The procedures 
can define the relation between the information system where the incident might occur and the external 
incident detection system, which would have the task to detect an incident or can define how humans 
operating or administering information systems, detect an incident. Examples of external incident 
detection systems are intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, log-analysing systems, 
change-tracking systems, etc.
The incident detection process includes not only the detection of the incident, but also the classification 
and description of the incident, which has a significant influence on the rest of the process. For example, 
the digital investigation would take a completely different course if the incident was described as 
“unauthorized access to the root account of the operating system”, than if it was described as ‘using the 
computer to distribute abusive images’.
Based on the above, this process may consist of three sub-processes: incident detection, incident 
classification, and incident description.
It is important to note that the incident classification and incident description sub-processes should be 
performed based on information gathered prior to incident detection and should not include any activity 
﻿

﻿
ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
(e.g. running some data analysis software on the system) that might alter data at the information system 
in which incident has occurred, in order to preserve digital evidence.
NOTE	
The incident detection process is included in the digital investigation processes as a starting point. 
The reasoning behind defining the incident detection process as the first process, and not as a preparation or 
planning process is that digital investigation readiness activities should exist in a process separate to the rest of 
the digital investigation process. This is so because digital investigation practitioners can never ensure that each 
system they will be working or will have digital investigation readiness activities implemented. If preparation 
and planning for digital investigations would exist prior to incident detection, then this would be part of digital 
investigation readiness. Therefore, the actual digital investigation starts with incident detection and first response, 
followed by preparation and planning processes, which are concerned with the rest of the digital investigation 
process rather than with the digital investigation readiness process.
8.3	 First response process
The first response process should include the first response to the detected incident. Also see ISO/IEC 27037 
for more information on incident response. Depending on the type and severity of the incident, this might 
include disconnecting equipment from a networked environment, detecting corrupted data, etc. It is 
required that the first response does not have a negative influence on the possibility to perform a digital 
investigation, e.g. to avoid powering off the equipment, opening or changing files on a live system etc.
Defining the first response sub-processes is out of the scope of this International Standard, as these can 
vary greatly depend on the type of target information systems, data contained in the target information 
system, circumstances of the incident, classification and description of the incident, etc.
The first response process is included as a process because it falls within the scope of any digital 
investigation since such a process will assure the integrity of potential digital evidence.
8.4	 Planning process
During this process, the investigator has to perform all the potential planning needed for later in the 
digital investigation process. Planning should include the use of defined ISO/IEC 27041 based validated 
processes to develop relevant procedures and methodologies to be used, planning for use of appropriate 
human resources. and the planning of all activities during other processes.
If digital investigation readiness controls were implemented, the investigator should plan how to use the 
results of those controls so as to maximize the success of the digital investigation process. The aims of the 
digital investigation readiness process are to maximize the potential use of potential digital evidence, 
minimize the costs of the investigation, minimize interference with and prevent the interruption of 
business processes, and to preserve or improve the current level of information systems security.
The planning process is included because it is of extreme importance due to the fact that it determines 
the efficiency and success of all the other processes.
8.5	 Preparation process
Preparation process activities are intended to prepare an organization for performing activities within 
this process that might include — but is not limited to — the preparation of relevant equipment (hardware 
and software), infrastructure, human resources, raising awareness, training, and documentation. During 
this process, preparations also have to be made to implement procedures defined in the previous process.
This process is included since such a process will ensure that the investigator is better prepared in order 
to carry out the acquisitive processes in a more efficient manner. This will also ensure that the integrity 
of potential digital evidence is not compromised due to possible ill-preparedness by the investigator.

9	 Acquisitive processes
9.1	 Overview of acquisitive processes
The acquisitive processes class consists of processes that are concerned with acquisition of potential 
digital evidence. Figure 6 depicts the acquisitive processes, including the
—	 potential digital evidence identification process,
—	 potential digital evidence collection process,
—	 potential digital evidence acquisition (optional),
—	 potential digital evidence transportation process, and
—	 potential digital evidence storage process.
Figure 6 — Acquisitive processes
9.2 Potential digital evidence identification process
This is the second process performed at the scene of the incident. Although it overlaps in time with the 
previous process, it should be considered as a separate process because it includes different types of 
procedures within the process, with the specific aim of identifying potential digital evidence.
Identifying potential digital evidence at the incident scene is of crucial importance for the remainder of 
the process, because if potential digital evidence is not identified at this point, it might not even exist at 
a later point during the process. This is especially important when an incident happens in a networked

ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
environment, in an environment where live investigations should be performed, in a cloud environment 
or in an environment with exceptionally large amounts of data to deal with.
This process is included with the sole aim to identify potential digital evidence.
9.3	 Potential digital evidence collection process
Once potential digital evidence has been identified, it has to be collected in order to permit its analysis 
in a later process.
Potential digital evidence must be collected in such a manner that its integrity is preserved. This is 
important if one needs to use this evidence at a later stage to draw some formal conclusions, i.e. in a 
court of law. Adhering to strict legal regulations during the evidence collection process is of crucial 
importance, as digital evidence might become unusable when proper procedures are not followed.
9.4	 Potential digital evidence acquisition process
Once potential digital evidence has been collected, it has to be acquired in order to permit its analysis 
in a later process.
Proper data acquisition of protected devices with additional security controls such as data encryption 
should be considered. Guidance on this, and sound processes for handling potential digital evidence, 
is found in ISO/IEC 27037. Adhering to strict legal regulations during the potential digital evidence 
acquisition process is of crucial importance, as potential digital evidence might become unusable when 
proper procedures are not followed.
It is common practice to make verifiable images (see ISO/IEC 27037) using hash functions (see ISO/IEC 10118-
2) of all the bits contained within each media item that contains potential digital evidence.
Professionals and scientists in the digital investigation field have a task to develop proper procedures 
for the acquisition of potential digital evidence that is applicable to networked environments, the live 
investigation process, cloud environments, and environments with large amounts of data.
Take note that this process is optional at this stage, since it is not always possible to acquire one or 
more images of the evidence after it has been collected. It often happens that the image acquisition 
only takes place within an investigation laboratory and, hence, this process might only occur within the 
investigative processes class. Although this process is marked as optional at this stage as well as within 
the investigative processes class, it is imperative that exactly one instance of the process is carried out, 
i.e. either here or within the investigative processes class. This process, as described in this clause, is 
exactly the same as the first process within the investigative processes class and is not described again 
within the investigative processes class.
9.5	 Potential digital evidence transportation process
During this process, potential digital evidence is to be transported to a location where it is to be stored 
and later analysed. Transportation can be done physically or electronically. If the evidence is transported 
electronically, special precautions have to be taken to preserve the integrity and chain of custody, such 
as encrypting and digitally signing data.
9.6	 Potential digital evidence storage and preservation process
The storage of potential digital evidence might be needed if analysis cannot be performed right away or 
if there is a legal requirement to keep potential digital evidence for a certain period of time.
Preservation of the integrity of the evidence and chain of custody is of utmost importance during this 
process. Care should also be taken not to damage the media containing potential digital evidence due to 
shock, temperature, humidity, pollution, loss of power, malfunction, etc.

10	Investigative processes
10.1	Overview of investigative processes
The investigative processes class consists of processes that are concerned with investigating the 
incident that is the cause of the digital investigation and is concerned with analysing the evidence, 
interpreting results from the analysis, reporting on results of the digital evidence interpretation process 
and presenting these results in a court of law or to the relevant parties involved. Finally, the digital 
investigation draws to a close within the investigation closure process. Figure 7 depicts the investigative 
processes, including the
—	 potential digital evidence acquisition (optional),
—	 potential digital evidence examination and analysis process,
—	 digital evidence interpretation process,
—	 reporting process,
—	 presentation process, and
—	 investigation closure process.

ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
10.2	Potential digital evidence acquisition process
See 9.4 for a description of this process.
10.3	Potential digital evidence examination and analysis process
Examination and analysis of the digital evidence involves the use of a large number of techniques to 
identify digital evidence as well as reconstructing it, if needed. In order to make a hypothesis on how the 
incident occurred, one should define what its exact characteristics are and who is to be held responsible. 
Making a hypothesis basically involves the reconstruction of a sequence of events that have led to the 
current state of the system being investigated. Due to the volume, diversity and complexity of the data 
to be analysed in present-day digital investigations, the analysis of evidence becomes a challenge.
As volumes of data to be examined and analysed can be vast, accredited automated techniques are often 
employed to complement manual validation techniques.
See ISO/IEC 27042 for details on the digital evidence analysis process.
It should be noted that from this point onwards, “potential digital evidence” becomes “digital evidence” 
according to the definitions of ‘potential digital evidence’ and ‘digital evidence’.
10.4	Digital evidence interpretation process
The results from the potential digital evidence examination and analysis process should then be 
interpreted. Interpretation of any evidence is dependent on the information available about the 
circumstances surrounding the creation of that item of digital evidence. To be able to carry out a proper 
interpretation, information from persons involved in the day-to-day running of the system(s) which are 
being investigated, is often required. Furthermore, information about the purpose of the investigation 
and a definition of the scope of the investigation is also required.
One goal of the digital evidence interpretation process is to use scientifically proven methods to construct 
explanations for the presence of the digital artefacts identified as well as likelihood estimates for each 
investigation during the potential digital evidence examination and analysis process, within the context of 
the investigation. If the contextual information changes, the interpretation may also have to change in 
order to reflect changes to the contextual information. A further goal of the digital evidence interpretation 
process is to classify the interpreted evidence according to relevance. This means that the evidence, as 
interpreted, is organized in such a way that it is distinguished which digital evidence artefacts are more 
important than others. The decision process on deciding which pieces of digital evidence would be more 
important than others is left to the discretion of one or more competent investigators.
See ISO/IEC 27042 for details on the digital evidence interpretation process.
10.5	Reporting process
The interpretation that results from the digital evidence interpretation process forms the main output, 
i.e. the report. The report should, where economical, be printed on paper. It is possible that during a 
certain digital investigation, the number of digital evidence artefacts could be many. Therefore, due 
diligence should be exercised to list all relevant digital evidence in the report in order to assure that no 
valuable evidence is omitted from the report.
The report should be written in simple language and should be clear, concise and unambiguous in its 
statements. It should also be understandable for a wide audience whom do not necessarily possess a 
technical understanding of incident investigations. Such audiences include, but not limited to, judges, juries, 
the accused, lawyers, prosecutors, an organization’s management team, shareholders, and employees.
The author(s) of a report should always be aware of the potential impact of the report in a law suit on all 
the applicable audiences as mentioned above. Authors of such reports should also keep in mind possible 
consequences of potentially wrong or misinterpreted reports. Therefore, the report should elaborate 
on issues such as which potential evidence was collected/acquired, which analysis techniques were 
﻿

19


﻿
ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
performed, which statements and from whom have been taken into account and what outcome results 
from this. Sometimes no clear outcome is possible based on the available evidence. In such a case, the 
report should state clearly the assumptions made, the probabilities corresponding to the assumptions 
and the conclusions arising from the assumptions. It is essential to emphasize the hypothetical character 
of such conclusions.
10.6	Presentation process
The document created during the reporting process is to be presented to a wide audience as stated 
in this Clause. The main purpose of the presentation process is to conduct a live demonstration of the 
results based on the report. This demonstration can be performed using questions and answers, as 
an oral presentation, as a multimedia presentation, as an expert witness testimony or as whatever is 
suitable to the case.
The presentation process also includes proving the validity of the hypothesis if or when the hypothesis 
is challenged. Thus, the one who presents the hypothesis should be well prepared for it and should 
preferably have had insight into the reporting process.
10.7	Investigation closure process
This process concludes the investigation and a decision is to be recorded on the validity of the hypothesis set 
in the presentation process. The digital investigation process is iterative. This implies that — after completing 
this process — one can go back to any of the earlier processes that follow the first response process.
The closing process should include the following sub-processes:
—	 deciding on need to iterate to a previous process;
—	 record acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis;
—	 returning evidence, if needed;
—	 destruction of evidence, if needed. There are various laws in different jurisdictions. The way in 
which evidence is destroyed, or whether it is destroyed at all, or whether it needs to be stored 
for a certain period of time after the case has been completed, all depends on the local laws. The 
investigator should take cognisance of this. More information on the destruction of data can be 
found in ISO/IEC 27040. More information on storage of data can be found in ISO 15489-1;
—	 distribution of relevant information to all stakeholders (i.e. communicating the need to iterate to 
a previous process, deciding on the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis, or providing any 
reports or documents from the presentation process);
—	 project debriefing and lessons learned.
11	Concurrent processes
11.1	Overview of the concurrent processes
In addition to the digital investigation processes classes (i.e. the readiness, initialization, acquisitive, 
and investigative processes classes), a number of processes (i.e. the concurrent processes class) exist 
that take place alongside with these digital investigation processes. These processes include the
—	 obtaining authorization process,
—	 documentation process,
—	 managing information flow process,
—	 preserving chain of custody process,
﻿
20

﻿
ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
—	 preserving digital evidence process, and
—	 interaction with physical investigation process.
Concurrent processes are defined as the principles which should be applied throughout the digital 
investigation process since such concurrent processes are applicable to many other processes within 
the digital investigation process. For example, documentation is a concurrent process that is applicable 
to all processes within the digital investigation process, since all tasks carried out during the entire 
digital investigation process should be thoroughly logged and documented.
The concurrent processes suggested above are justified, since the principles of the digital investigation 
process, as well as the preservation of the evidence and chain of custody, should be translated into 
actionable items. These processes should run concurrently with all other processes in order to assure 
full admissibility of the digital evidence in a court of law. Moreover, legacy processes (such as obtaining 
authorization, documentation, and interaction with the physical investigation) should actually run across 
several or all processes. The aim of these concurrent processes is to achieve higher efficiency of the 
investigation. Information flow should also be defined as a separate concurrent process.
The concurrent processes are explained next.
11.2	Obtaining authorization process
Proper authorization should be obtained for each process performed within all of the digital investigation 
processes. Authorization might be required from government authorities, system owners, system 
custodians, principals, users etc. It is important to obtain proper authorization for actions performed 
during the digital investigation process in order not to infringe on the rights of system owners, 
custodians, principals, or users, but also to assure that no legal rule is infringed. Needed authorizations 
would depend on the environment where the digital investigation is performed, both within the legal 
and the organizational environment.
11.3	Documentation process
Each process performed should be documented in order to assure repeatability and reproducibility, 
preserve chain of custody, but also to improve efficiency and a higher probability of a successful digital 
investigation. Proper documentation should also be demonstrated during the presentation process.
This process should include incident scene documentation which is performed at the scene of the 
incident, if applicable, and involves the proper documentation of the complete incident scene, including 
written documentation of activities, sketches, photographs, videos, and labelling the potential digital 
evidence. All activities performed in relation to the digital investigation processes should be recorded, 
together with details on the architecture and components of the information system where the incident 
occurred, if applicable.
11.4 Managing information flow process
A defined information flow should exist between each of the processes and among different stakeholders. 
This information flow has to be defined for each type of investigation. It is important to identify and 
describe information flows so that they can be secured and supported technologically. For instance, an 
information flow could refer to the exchange of digital evidence between two investigators involved 
in the same investigation. Protection of this information flow can be in the form of, for example, the 
use of trusted PKI and time stamping to identify the different investigators and authenticate evidence 
(protecting its integrity), as well as to protect the confidentiality of the evidence.
11.5	Preserving chain of custody process
All legal requirements should be complied with and all processes should be properly documented in 
order to preserve chain of custody as the evidence is handled by several parties. This process is to be 
performed from the incident detection process until the last process.
﻿
© ISO/IEC 2015 – All rights reserved
21


﻿
ISO/IEC 27043:2015(E)
11.6	Preserving digital evidence process
Preserving digital evidence means to preserve the integrity of the original digital evidence. In order to 
achieve this, one should conform to strict procedures from the time that the incident is detected until 
such time as the investigation is closed. These procedures should ensure that the original evidence is not 
changed and, even more important, they should guarantee that no opportunity arises during which the 
original evidence may be changed, lost, stolen, destroyed, etc.
11.7	Interaction with physical investigation process
The digital investigation process can be dependent on and interconnected with the physical investigation, 
if such an investigation is conducted in relation to the same incident. Therefore, this activity should 
define the relationship between the digital investigation process and the physical investigation. The 
interaction is important for preserving the chain of custody, preserving the integrity of the digital 
evidence, protecting the digital evidence from damage, and ensuring an efficient investigation according 
to the investigator’s needs and fast adaption to changing boundaries, scope, or investigation objectives.
12	Digital investigation process model schema
Figure 8 represents the entire digital investigation processes, combining Figures 4 to 7 in order to 
view the digital investigation process in its totality. As mentioned earlier, note that the processes 
are sequential — with the exception of evidence identification process, which may overlap in time. 
Also, note that not all concurrent processes run concurrently with all other processes. For instance, 
preserving chain of custody and preserving digital evidence interaction concurrent processes start only 
with the implementing pre-incident collection, storage, and handling of data representing potential digital 
evidence process. However, these are not performed during assessment process group in readiness class 
of processes. Also, interaction with physical investigation process starts only with first response process.
The digital investigation processes are iterative, which implies that after the last process one can return 
to previous process. Note, however, that iteration is optional and that one can only return to certain 
processes, as shown on Figure 8. One can only go back to planning process, preparation process, potential 
digital evidence identification process, potential digital evidence acquisition process, digital evidence 
analysis process, digital evidence interpretation process, reporting process, or presentation process.
What follows is a list of examples when processes can be iterative:
a)	 When, during the investigation closure process, it is noted that there is a need for additional digital 
evidence and that not all potential digital evidence were identified, one would go to the potential 
digital evidence identification process.
b)	 When, during the investigation closure process, it is noted that there is a need for additional 
examination and analysis or interpretation of digital evidence, for the reason that hypothesis 
presented cannot be adopted by stakeholders, one would go back to digital evidence analysis or 
digital evidence interpretation process.
c)	
When, during the investigation closure process it is noted that digital investigation findings were 
not presented up to the standard requested, one would go back to either reporting process or 
presentation process.
Take note that the above list of examples is neither comprehensive nor exclusive.
NOTE	
The preserving chain of custody and preserving digital evidence processes within the concurrent processes 
class in Figure 8 do not run concurrently with the following two processes within the readiness processes class: 
assessment of implementation and implementation of assessment results. For clarity, see Figure 4 again.

Annex A 
(informative) 
 
Digital investigation processes: motivation for harmonization
Based on numerous currently-published digital investigation process models,[3] to [17] there exist clear 
disparities among such digital investigation process models by the time of writing this International 
Standard. Disparities include: different number of investigation processes included, different scope of 
process models, different scope of the processes with the same names within different process models, 
different hierarchy levels and even different concepts applied to the construction of the process model 
(e.g. most of the models are based on a physical crime investigation processes).
Processes have been selected based on previous work[3] to [17] in this field in order to harmonize the 
digital investigation processes. Existing models are compared with the harmonized digital investigation 
process model in Table A.1. The harmonized model is mapped to existing models in a bid to show how 
it compared with existing models by the time of writing this International Standard. This also serves 
as further motivation why the harmonized digital investigation process model should be standardized.
The harmonized model is iterative and multi-tiered. Sub-processes of the model are not shown on the 
comparison table for the sake of simplicity of view. Each mapped process starts with a number, marking 
a sequence of processes within the model with which comparison is being made.
Ideally, all planning of activities (planning, defining of the approach strategy, defining of the response 
strategy, etc.) should be done prior to the incident — thus during the planning process.
Based on the comparison made in Table A.1, the comprehensiveness of the harmonized model should 
be trivial. The “concurrent processes” principle is also introduced, as it would assure higher efficiency 
and digital evidence admissibility. Note also that the order of the processes differs from some of the 
previous models and that the order makes provision for a more efficient process, such as that a digital 
investigation readiness process should be kept separate from the digital investigation process. Incident 
detection and first response should be included in the digital investigation process model.
The harmonized digital investigation process model is comprehensive and inclusive of all the benefits 
conveyed by previous models. The processes in the proposed model are well defined in terms of scope, 
functions and order. Several processes to be performed are also provided which operates concurrently 
with the initial processes of the model, in order to achieve efficiency of investigation and ensure the best 
possible admissibility of digital evidence. These processes provide the principles in digital investigations.
Use of the harmonized digital investigation process model should bring about multiple benefits. A first 
benefit would be the higher admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law, due to the fact that a 
standardized process was followed. Also, human error and omissions during the digital investigation 
process would be minimized once such a harmonized process model was used.
Usage of the model across national borders should enable modern society to fight cybercrime far more 
efficiently, and interaction between private and government entities should also be made much easier 
and more efficient. Last, but not least, the digital investigation process should ultimately enhance the 
efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of digital investigations.

ABSTRACT 
 
The Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project at the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of 
Commerce, provides a measure of confidence in the software tools used in computer 
forensic investigations. CFTT focuses on a class of tools called disk-imaging tools that 
copy or “image” hard disk drives. Forensic Software Testing Support Tools (FS-TST) is a 
software package that supports the testing of disk imaging tools. FS-TST includes 15 
tools that perform hard disk initialization, faulty disk simulation, hard disk comparisons, 
extraction of information from a hard disk, and copying of disks or disk partitions. 
 
This NIST Interagency/Internal Report consists of two parts.  Part A, covers the planning, 
design and specification of testing the tools included in the FS-TST package.  Part B, 
which is this document, covers the test summary report. 
 
The testing was independently performed by VDG, Inc. under contract to NIST. 
 
Keywords: computer forensics; disk imaging; software testing, testing support 
tools. 
 
Certain trade names and company products are mentioned in the text or identified. In no 
case does such identification imply recommendation or endorsement by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the products are necessarily 
the best available for the purpose.

3 Summary of Results 
The majority of the FS-TST tools passed all tests. However, partab, diskchg, seccopy, 
partcmp, sechash, adjcmp, and corrupt did not pass some of the tests. These failure cases 
are outlined in Section 3.1. 
 
A few tools failed to pass some tests only when they were run in environments not 
prescribed in their available documentation. Section 3.2 outlines these failures. 
 
Section 3.3 includes a few observations regarding the behavior of some tools, which 
could be used when writing a new FS-TST version. 
 
Section 3.4 comprises a summary of test case results. 
3.1 Failed Tests 
3.1.1 Partab Failures 
1. Partab does not recognize a primary FAT32 partition larger than 8GB. Instead, it 
reports finding a primary extended partition with two sub-partitions of unknown types. 
This problem appears for all tools that try to display or use entries in the partition table 
(partcmp, partab, adjcmp.) 
 
Test cases: Ptb-13. 
3.1.2 Diskchg Failures 
1. Diskchg feature 5 did not pass the test.  Feature 5 specifies that diskchg must set a 
sector s to the contents that diskwipe would use for the sector at location a on a disk 
with the specified geometry using the specified fill value. In this test case, s is 5/1/1, a 
is 6/1/1, and the specified geometry is 200 heads/cylinder. With this geometry, 
diskwipe fills a with the header 00007/131/01 000000096453. It was expected 
diskchg to fill s with same header. However, diskchg filled s with the header 
00006/001/01 000000096453. 
 
Test case: Dch-09. 
3.1.3 Seccopy Failures 
1. Seccopy fails to copy a group of sectors containing the last sector of a disk. For a disk 
reported to have n sectors by ATA “identify device” command, the test specified the 
group of last 4 sectors starting at sector number n-4 and having length 3. Seccopy 
erroneously reported, “Copy length (4) exceeds (12594960) Source disk size 
(12594956)”. The error is probably due to an incorrect comparison between start_address 
+ count and last_sector (>= instead of >). 
 


 
3
Test case: Scy-02. 
 
2. Seccopy fails to copy a group of sectors to a destination address, such that the copy 
would contain the last sector of the destination disk. Seccopy erroneously reported, 
“Copy length (3) exceeds (3335472) Destination disk size (3335469)”. The error is 
probably due to an incorrect comparison between start_address + count and last_sector 
for the destination drive. 
 
Test case: Scy-03. 
3.1.4 Partcmp Failures 
1. Partcmp fails to recognize and correctly compare primary FAT32 partitions larger than 
8GB. This problem appears for all tools that try to display or use entries in the partition 
table (partcmp, partab, adjcmp.) 
 
Test case: Pcp-08. 
3.1.5 Sechash Failures 
1. Sechash fails to compute the SHA1 hash value for a sector group consisting of only 
one sector. Actually sechash terminates abnormally with the message: 
 
Floating point error: Divide by zero. 
 
The tester guessed that when sechash tries to compute the percentage of sectors 
processed so far, it incorrectly computes the total number of sectors to be processed by 
subtracting first sector address from the last sector address. This way, for a group of 1 
sectors, the total number computed would be 0. 
 
Test cases: Shs-03, Shs-06. 
 
2. Sechash incorrectly assumes that it should compute the hash value of the entire disk 
when the sector group consists of only the first sector (LBA 0). 
 
Test case: Shs-03. 
 
3. Sechash fails to detect an incorrect range of sector addresses specified on the 
command line using for example a /last address less than the /first address; instead it 
starts computing the hash value for a sector group of incorrect length. 
 
Test case: Shs-07. 
3.1.6 Adjcmp Failures 
1. Adjcmp fails to recognize and correctly compare primary FAT32 partitions larger than 
8GB. This problem appears for all tools that try to display or use entries in the partition 
table (partcmp, partab, adjcmp.) 
 


 
4
Test case: Acp-05. 
3.1.7 Corrupt Failures 
1. Corrupt fails to detect a byte offset outside the file range. It terminates abnormally 
with the message: 
 
Z:\SS\CORRUPT.EXE: Read failed 
 
Test case: Cor-03. 
3.2 Environment-related Failures 
The failures reported in this section occurred are the result of  unintentional changes to 
the environment in which the tools are supposed to run. Consequently, these failures were 
not considered when deciding whether a tool passed or not a test case. 
3.2.1 Partab Failures 
1. Partab fails to distinguish a HPFS partition from a NTFS partition, because the 
partition type byte in the partition table entry is the same (0x07) for both types of 
partitions. Consequently, partab reports a HPFS partition as being NTFS. 
 
Test cases: Ptb-07. 
3.2.2 Badx13 Failures 
1. Badx13 fails to detect a sector address outside the disk range. 
 
Test cases: Bdx-08. 
 
2. Badx13 fails to detect it is running on a computer with legacy BIOS.  
 
Test case: Bdx-09. 
3.3 Observations 
3.3.1 Seccopy and other FS-TST tools: LBA vs. CHS in partition start address 
seccopy was used a few times to copy a source partition to a destination partition in order 
for the partitions to compare equal. The obvious way to obtain the source and destination 
group of sectors’ start address and length is to look in the partition table displayed by 
partab or partcmp, where one can find the partition start address in LBA or CHS format. 
The tester should be aware that the CHS address found in the partition table (as displayed 
by FS-TST tools) cannot be used to copy the partition’s sectors using seccopy or other 
FS-TST tool, because the BIOS (and hence the tools) might use a different disk geometry 
to compensate for its limitations, and one might end up copying the wrong source sectors 
to the wrong destination (see for example test case Pcp-09.)  


 
5
3.3.2 Badx13 and other FS-TST tools: write error code 
Badx13 correctly monitors a sector for write commands: the FS-TST tool used to check 
the monitoring (diskchg) detects a write error, but does not display the error code. It is 
unclear whether this is badx13 or diskchg fault. See test cases Bdx-01, Bdx-03. 
3.3.3 Badx13 and other FS-TST tools: residual warning 
Badx13 correctly monitors a sector for read commands: the FS-TST tool used to check 
the monitoring (diskchg) detects a read error and displays the correct error code. 
However, when the same tool is used to read a neighboring sector supposedly not 
monitored by badx13, it displays a warning on the standard output (the warning is not 
logged – see test cases Bdx-03, Bdx-06): 
 
RD: make bad 
Z:\SS\DISKCHG.EXE could not access drive 81 status code 32 
 
Still, diskchg is able to read and display that sector.

Expected Results: 
Seccmp creates a new log file. 
Seccmp prompts the user for a comment. 
The comment is logged. 
Logged information is correct. 
Seccmp determines that the sectors are diskwipe-style 
filled, BUT with fill values different from those specified 
on the command line. Seccmp compares the sectors, finds 
them different, and logs the number of bytes that differ. 
 
Note: Actually, seccmp is not required to compare the 
sectors, because they are diskwipe-style filled. 
Actual Results: 
It seems that Seccmp ignores the fill values specified on 
the command line. Otherwise, no anomalies are detected. 
Analysis: 
Expected results achieved, except that the fill values 
specified on the command line appear to be unused. 
Seccmp should, at least, detect that the actual fill values 
differ from those specified.

Seccopy incorrectly detects that the source sectors extend

The expected results were not achieved, either because 
diskcopy incorrectly computes the disk size (see last line

the source_address+count and the last_sector_address.

Seccmp copies the sectors as specified. 
Actual Results: 
Seccopy incorrectly detects that the destination sectors 
extend beyond the last disk sector, and does not copy any 
sector. 
Analysis: 
Expected results were not achieved, probably due to an 
incorrect comparison between destination_address + count 
and last_sector_address.

Expected Results:

captured in BADDISK.LOG, installs itself as a TSR, and 
begin monitoring disk read commands for the specified 
sectors. 
Actual Results: 
No anomalies detected. 
 
Note. It was expected baddisk to detect and use the disk 
geometry like the other FS-TST tools (e.g., diskchg, viz. 
running it in this test case). Seems that baddisk warns the 
user if a specified sector lies outside the range reported by 
BIOS interrupt 13, but still monitors I/O commands for 
that sector. 
Analysis: 
Expected results achieved.

The user is prompted to enter a comment. 
The comment and program execution are logged. 
Logged information is correct. 
Partcmp compares the partitions on the length of the 
smaller one and correctly reports the sizes and the number 
of equal and different sectors. 
Actual Results: 
Partcmp displays an incorrect partition table (like partab) 
for both disks. However, it compares sectors starting at the 
correct address, but the test cannot trust the number of 
sectors being compared or the comparison results. 
Analysis: 
Expected results NOT achieved.

The user is prompted to enter a comment. 
The comment and program execution are logged. 
Logged information is correct. 
Partcmp compares the partitions and correctly reports the 
sizes and the number of equal and different sectors. Since 
the test copied the partitions, this should expect partition 
contents to be equal. 
Actual Results: 
No anomalies were detected. 
 
Note. Run seccopy using LBA sector addressing. Do not 
use C/H/S addresses in the partition table as displayed by 
partcmp or partab or other tools like PartitionMagic. FS-
TST tools might use different disk geometry, and you 
might end up copying the wrong source sectors to the 
wrong destination. 
Analysis: 
Expected results achieved.

The comment and program execution are logged. 
Logged information is correct. 
Diskcmp compares the disks and logs the capacities, the 
number of sectors compared, and the number of equal and 
different sectors. Due to filling the disks with different 
values, the test expect all compared sectors to be different. 
Actual Results: 
No anomalies detected. 
Note: It was expected that the fill values entered as 
arguments on diskcmp’s command line to be used in some 
way. It seems that they are not used in this case. However, 
in case Dcp-02 when the destination was larger, diskcmp 
displayed a count of zero- and diskwipe style filled 
sectors.

Expected Results: 
Adjcmp creates a new log file CMPALOG.TXT. Adjcmp 
logs the comment, the source and destination drives, the 
program execution, logs the boot tracks, partitions and 
unallocated space of each disk, automatically assigns source 
disk chunks to destination chunks, compares them, and logs 
the comparison result and a summary as described in the 
features. 
Actual Results: 
No anomalies detected. 
Analysis: 
Expected results were achieved. 
 
Case Acp-02 
Case Summary: 
Run adjcmp to compare the “chunks” of two disks using: 
- 
A computer with legacy BIOS.

assignment, logs the comparison results and a summary, 
as detailed in the features. 
Actual Results: 
Adjcmp does not detect the correct number and size of the 
partitions when a primary FAT32 partition is involved. 
Also, when logging the disk layout, it seems to enter a 
long (infinite?) loop, displaying incorrect chunk 
information. 
Analysis: 
Expected results were NOT achieved. 
 
Case Acp-06 
Case Summary: 
Run adjcmp to compare the “chunks” of two disks using: 
- 
A computer with extended BIOS. 
- 
IDE source and destination hard disk drives. 
- 
Large (>8GB) logical FAT32 partitions on source 
and destination disks. 
- 
Use automatic assignment of disk chunks. 
- 
Use /new_log.

Diskwipe logs the correct model and serial numbers. 
Diskwipe logs correct maximum number of sectors as

Actual Results: 
No anomalies detected. 
Analysis: 
Expected results achieved. 
 
Note. It cannot be checked that the C/H/S values logged by diskwipe are the values 
returned by interrupt 13h function 08h, but they appear to be reasonable. The argument is 
based on the real and computed capacity of the hard disk drive based on the reported 
figures. 783 cyls * 255 heads * 63 sectors/track = 12578895 sectors = 6142 MB, while 
the known capacity of the disk is 6149MB. Probably the legacy BIOS cannot represent 
the real geometry in the 10, 8 and 6 bits reserved for cylinder, head, and sector, so it 
adjusts the disk geometry to a new one (783/255/63) and translates the sector addresses 
conform to the new geometry. As a result, some sectors are no longer addressable. The 
capacity loss is about 0.1%, which seems reasonable.

Expected Results: 
Diskwipe logs an extended BIOS in the log file. 
Diskwipe logs reasonable values as the maximum C/H/S 
values. 
Diskwipe logs reasonable C/H/S values as the values 
reported by int. 13h function 48h. 
Diskwipe logs the correct model and serial numbers. 
Diskwipe logs correct maximum number of sectors as 
reported by ATA identify device command. 
Actual Results: 
No anomalies detected. 
Analysis: 
Expected results achieved. 
 
Note. The C/H/S values logged as being returned by function 48h of interrupt 13h can be 
verified by observing that they are the same values that are recorded on the hard disk 
cover. 
 
The C/H/S values returned by function 08h cannot be correct, the number of cylinders 
being too large to be represented in 10 bits. Therefore, to access as many sectors as 
possible in CHS mode, BIOS must translate addresses using the geometry reported of 
1023/255/63 (cylinders in the 0-1022 range, heads in the 0-254 range, sectors in the 1-63 
range). Therefore, the maximum number of sectors addressable that way is 1023*255*63 
= 16,434,495 sectors, versus 16,514,064 sectors, number computed using the geometry 
reported by function 48h. The capacity loss is less than 0.5%, which seems reasonable. 
 
The maximum number of user addressable sectors reported by ATA identify device 
command, 39,102,336, is also reasonable, because it indicates a disk capacity of about 
19093MB, and the known capacity of the disk is 19GB. 
 
Note. One can also test whether the maximum number of user addressable sectors logged 
is reasonable by trying to read the sectors 39102335 and 39102336 using the diskchg tool 
for example. While it should be possible to read the first sector, trying to read the second 
one should fail. This was tried and the expectations were confirmed.

Diskwipe logs reasonable values as the maximum C/H/S

Diskwipe logs the correct model and serial numbers. 
Diskwipe logs correct maximum number of sectors as

Actual Results: 
No anomalies detected. 
Analysis: 
Expected results achieved. 
 
Note. SCSI drives use the LBA addressing scheme. Therefore, it suffices that the total 
number of sectors logged, 35,885,448, be reasonable. According to this number of 
sectors, the disk should have about 17522MB, which is close to the known capacity of 
17.5GB. Accordingly, this figure is considered to be reasonable. 
One can also test whether the total number of sectors logged by diskwipe is reasonable by 
trying to read the sectors 35885447 and 35885448 using the diskchg tool for example. 
While it should be possible to read the first sector, trying to read the second one should 
fail. This was tried and the expectations were confirmed.

Introduction 
The Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) program is a joint project of the National 
Institute of Justice (NIJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology Law Enforcement Standards Office (OLES) and 
Information Technology Laboratory (ITL). CFTT is supported by other organizations, 
including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Defense Cyber 
Crime Center, U.S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division Electronic 
Crimes Program, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Bureau of 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. 
Secret Service. The objective of the CFTT program is to provide measurable assurance to 
practitioners, researchers, and other applicable users that the tools used in computer 
forensics investigations provide accurate results. Accomplishing this requires the 
development of specifications and test methods for computer forensics tools and 
subsequent testing of specific tools against those specifications.  
Test results provide the information necessary for developers to improve tools, users to 
make informed choices, and the legal community and others to understand the tools’ 
capabilities. The CFTT approach to testing computer forensics tools is based on well-
recognized methodologies for conformance and quality testing. The specifications and 
test methods are posted on the CFTT Web site (http://www.cftt.nist.gov/) for review and 
comment by the computer forensics community. 
This document reports the results from testing X-Ways Forensics Version 16.2 SR-5 
against the Digital Data Acquisition Tool Assertions and Test Plan Version 1.0, available 
at the CFTT Web site (http://www.cftt.nist.gov/DA-ATP-pc-01.pdf). 
Test results from other tools can be found on NIJ’s computer forensics tool testing Web 
page, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/topics/technology/electronic-crime/cftt.htm. 
How to Read This Report 
This report is divided into five sections. The first section is a summary of the results from 
the test runs. This section is sufficient for most readers to assess the suitability of the tool 
for the intended use. The remaining sections of the report describe how the tests were 
conducted, discuss any anomalies that were encountered and provide documentation of 
test case run details that support the report summary. Section 2 gives justification for the 
selection of test cases from the set of possible cases defined in the test plan for Digital 
Data Acquisition tools. The test cases are selected, in general, based on features offered 
by the tool. Section 3 describes in more depth any anomalies summarized in the first 
section. Section 4 lists hardware and software used to run the test cases with links to 
additional information about the items used. Section 5 contains a description of each test 
case run. The description of each test run lists all test assertions used in the test case, the 
expected result and the actual result.  Please refer to the vendor documentation for 
guidance on using the tool.

1 Results Summary 
X-Ways Forensics version 16.2 SR-5 is designed to image, clone and restore data from 
hard drives and other secondary storage. Except for three test cases involving NTFS 
partitions, the tool acquired test media completely and accurately. When the tool cloned 
an NTFS partition (test case DA-02-NT) and when the images of previously acquired 
NTFS partitions were restored (test cases DA-14-NT and DA-14-NT-ALT), some sectors 
on the target partitions did not match the partitions that were acquired. The differences 
appear to be changes made by Windows; an artifact of the tool’s operating environment 
(Windows 7 and Windows XP). The tool had no control over these changes. The vendor 
references this issue in the X-Ways user manual; “An image is usually preferable to a 
clone, as all data (and metadata such as timestamps) in an image file is protected from the 
operating system.” 
Additional observations: 
•  The tool allows the user to restore the image of a partition. For FAT32 and exFAT 
file system types, if the user selects a Windows drive letter (e.g., c: or e:) or a 
partition containing a file system as the destination, Windows may make some 
changes to file system metadata on the destination partition causing a difference 
of several sectors between the source partition and the destination partition it was 
restored to. No changes are made if a partition with no file system is selected as 
the destination. This is not an issue with the tool; this result is noted to make the 
reader aware of the difference between restoring an image of a partition to a 
logical drive vs. restoring an image of a partition to a partition formatted with a 
file system vs. restoring an image of a partition to an unformatted destination 
partition.

•  Selecting to acquire a Windows drive letter or logical drive (e.g., c: or e:) does not 
acquire volume slack. To acquire volume slack the partition must be selected and 
not the drive letter. This result is noted to make the reader aware of the difference 
between choosing a logical vs. a partition acquisition. 
Refer to sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 for more details. 
2 Test Case Selection 
Test cases used to test disk imaging tools are defined in Digital Data Acquisition Tool 
Assertions and Test Plan Version 1.0. To test a tool, test cases are selected from the Test 
Plan document based on the features offered by the tool. Not all test cases or test 
assertions are appropriate for all tools. There is a core set of base cases (e.g., DA-06 and 
DA-07) that are executed for every tool tested. Tool features guide the selection of 
additional test cases. If a given tool implements a feature then the test cases linked to that 
feature are run. Table 1 lists the testable features of X-Ways Forensics 16.2 SR-5 and the 
linked test cases selected for execution. Table 2 lists the features not available in X-Ways 
Forensics 16.2 SR-5 and the test cases not executed.

object acquired, image file format and the execution environment.  In addition, the types 
of hash algorithms calculated, image file segment size and the type of hardware write 
blocker used were varied between test cases. 
The following source access interfaces were tested: ATA28, ATA48, SATA28, SATA48, 
SCSI, FW, and USB.  These are noted as variations on test cases DA-01, DA-06 and DA­
14. 
The following digital sources were tested: partitions (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, FAT32X, 
exFAT, NTFS), compact flash (CF), and thumb drive (Thumb). There are two FAT 32 
variations testing acquisition of both FAT 32 partition codes 0x0B (FAT32) and 0x0C 
(FAT32X).  These digital source types are noted as variations on test cases DA-02 and 
DA–07. 
The following image file types are supported by the tool: E01, compressed and encrypted. 
These were tested as alternate image file formats and are noted as variations on test case 
DA-10. 
3 Results by Test Assertion 
A test assertion is a verifiable statement about a single condition after an action is 
performed by the tool under test. A test case usually checks a group of assertions after the 
action of a single execution of the tool under test. Test assertions are defined and linked 
to test cases in Digital Data Acquisition Tool Assertions and Test Plan Version 1.0. 
Table 3 summarizes the test results for all the test cases by assertion. The column labeled 
Assertions Tested gives the text of each assertion. The column labeled Tests gives the 
number of test cases that use the given assertion. The column labeled Anomaly gives the 
section number in this report where any observed anomalies are discussed.

AO-10 If there is insufficient space to contain all
files of a multi-file image and if destination device 
switching is supported, the image is continued on
another device.

AO-12 If requested, a clone is created from an image
file.

AO-13 A clone is created using access interface DST­
AI to write to the clone device.

AO-14 If an unaligned clone is created, each sector
written to the clone is accurately written to the
same disk address on the clone that the sector 
occupied on the digital source.

3.1, 3.2 
AO-17 If requested, any excess sectors on a clone
destination device are not modified. 
12 
AO-19 If there is insufficient space to create a 
complete clone, a truncated clone is created using
all available sectors of the clone device.

AO-23 If the tool logs any log significant
information, the information is accurately recorded 
in the log file. 
56 
AO-24 If the tool executes in a forensically safe
execution environment, the digital source is
unchanged by the acquisition process. 
36 
Two test assertions only apply in special circumstances. The assertion AO-22 is checked 
only for tools that create block hashes. The assertion AO-24 is only checked if the tool is 
executed in a run time environment that does not modify attached storage devices, such 
as MS-DOS. In normal operation, an imaging tool is used in conjunction with a write 
block device to protect the source drive. Table 4 lists the assertions that were not tested, 
usually due to the tool not supporting some optional feature, e.g., creation of cylinder-
aligned clones.

Assertions not Tested 
AM-07 All hidden sectors are acquired from the digital source. 
AO-03 If there is an error while writing the image file, the tool
notifies the user. 
AO-06 If the tool performs an image file integrity check on an image
file that has not been changed since the file was created, the tool
shall notify the user that the image file has not been changed. 
AO-07 If the tool performs an image file integrity check on an image
file that has been changed since the file was created, the tool shall
notify the user that the image file has been changed. 
AO-08 If the tool performs an image file integrity check on an image
file that has been changed since the file was created, the tool shall
notify the user of the affected locations. 
AO-09 If the tool converts a source image file from one format to a
target image file in another format, the acquired data represented in
the target image file is the same as the acquired data in the source
image file. 
AO-15 If an aligned clone is created, each sector within a contiguous
span of sectors from the source is accurately written to the same disk
address on the clone device relative to the start of the span as the
sector occupied on the original digital source. A span of sectors is
defined to be either a mountable partition or a contiguous sequence of
sectors not part of a mountable partition. Extended partitions, which
may contain both mountable partitions and unallocated sectors, are not
mountable partitions. 
AO-16 If a subset of an image or acquisition is specified, all the
subset is cloned. 
AO-18 If requested, a benign fill is written to excess sectors of a
clone. 
AO-21 If there is a write error during clone creation, the tool
notifies the user. 
AO-22 If requested, the tool calculates block hashes for a specified
block size during an acquisition for each block acquired from the
digital source. 
3.1 Cloned or Restored NTFS Partitions 
When the tool cloned an NTFS partition, test case DA-02-NT, and when the image files 
of previously acquired NTFS partitions were restored, test cases DA-14-NT and DA-14­
NT-ALT, some sectors on the target partitions did not match the partitions that were 
acquired. These changes were made by the Windows operating system, not X-Ways; an 
artifact of the tool’s operating environment (Windows 7 and Windows XP). In test case 
DA-14-NT where the tool was run from Windows 7, 43,961 sectors differed. In test cases 
DA-02-NT and DA-14-NT-ALT where the tool was run from Windows XP, 147 and 139 
sectors differed. 
3.2 Restoring Images of Partitions With FAT32 and exFAT 
X-Ways can be used to restore the image of a partition. In testing the tool three methods 
were used: 
1) the image was restored to a logical drive

2) the image was restored to a partition formatted with a file system 
3) the image was restored to an unformatted partition 
When images of FAT32 and exFAT partitions were restored using methods 1 and 2 three 
sectors differed between the images and the target partitions. These were changes to file 
system metadata made by the Windows operating system. When method 3 was used all 
sectors matched. This is not an issue with the tool; this result is noted to make the reader 
aware of the difference between restoring an image of a partition to a logical drive vs. 
restoring an image of a partition to a partition formatted with a file system vs. restoring 
an image of a partition to an unformatted partition. 
3.3 Acquiring a Logical Drive Does Not Acquire Volume Slack 
Selecting to acquire a Windows drive letter or logical drive (e.g., c: or e:) does not 
acquire volume slack. To acquire volume slack the partition must be selected and not the 
drive letter. In test case DA-07-NT where the tool user selected to acquire the Windows 
drive letter, eight unused sectors at the end of the partition containing the NTFS file 
system were not acquired. The partition had 27,744,192 sectors but the tool acquired only 
27,744,184 sectors, skipping the last eight sectors of volume slack. When the partition 
was selected instead of the logical drive, test cases DA-02-NT and DA-07-NT-ALT, all 
sectors were acquired. This is not an issue with the tool; this result is noted to make the 
reader aware of the difference between choosing a logical vs. a partition acquisition.

4.3 Support Software 
A package of programs to support test analysis, FS-TST Release 2.0, was used. The 
software can be obtained from: http://www.cftt.nist.gov/diskimaging/fs-tst20.zip. 
4.4 Test Drive Creation 
There are three ways that a hard drive may be used in a tool test case: as a source drive 
that is imaged by the tool, as a media drive that contains image files created by the tool 
under test, or as a destination drive on which the tool under test creates a clone of the 
source drive. In addition to the operating system drive formatting tools, some tools 
(diskwipe and diskhash) from the FS-TST package are used to setup test drives. 
4.4.1 Source Drive 
The setup of most source drives follows the same general procedure, but there are several 
steps that may be varied depending on the needs of the test case. 
1.  The drive is filled with known data by the diskwipe program from FS-TST. The 
diskwipe program writes the sector address to each sector in both C/H/S and LBA 
format. The remainder of the sector bytes is set to a constant fill value unique for 
each drive. The fill value is noted in the diskwipe tool log file. 
2.  The drive may be formatted with partitions as required for the test case. 
3.  An operating system may optionally be installed. 
4.  A set of reference hashes is created by the FS-TST diskhash tool. These include 
both SHA1 and MD5 hashes. In addition to full drive hashes, hashes of each 
partition may also be computed. 
5.  If the drive is intended for hidden area tests (DA-08), an HPA, a DCO or both 
may be created. The diskhash tool is then used to calculate reference hashes of 
just the visible sectors of the drive.

The source drives for DA-09 are created such that there is a consistent set of faulty 
sectors on the drive. Each of these source drives is initialized with diskwipe and then 
their faulty sectors are activated. For each of these source drives, a duplicate drive, with 
no faulty sectors, serves as a reference drive for comparison. 
4.4.2 Media Drive 
To setup a media drive, the drive is formatted with one of the supported file systems. A 
media drive may be used in several test cases. 
4.4.3 Destination Drive 
To setup a destination drive, the drive is filled with known data by the diskwipe program 
from FS-TST. Partitions may be created if the test case involves restoring from the image 
of a logical acquire. 
4.5 Test Drive Analysis 
For test cases that create a clone of a physical device, e.g., DA-01, DA-04, etc., the 
destination drive is compared to the source drive with the diskcmp program from the FS­
TST package; for test cases that create a clone of a logical device, i.e., a partition, e.g., 
DA-02, DA-20, etc., the destination partition is compared to the source partition with the 
partcmp program. For a destination created from an image file, e.g., DA-14, the 
destination is compared, using either diskcmp (for physical device clones) or partcmp 
(for partition clones), to the source that was acquired to create the image file. Both 
diskcmp and partcmp note differences between the source and destination. If the 
destination is larger than the source it is scanned and the excess destination sectors are 
categorized as either, undisturbed (still containing the fill pattern written by diskwipe), 
zero filled or changed to something else. 
For test case DA-09, imaging a drive with known faulty sectors, the program anabad is 
used to compare the faulty sector reference drive to a cloned version of the faulty sector 
drive. 
For test cases such as DA-06 and DA-07 any acquisition hash computed by the tool under 
test is compared to the reference hash of the source to check that the source is completely 
and accurately acquired. 
4.6 Note on Test Drives 
The testing uses several test drives from a variety of vendors. The drives are identified by 
an external label that consists of a two digit hexadecimal value and an optional tag, e.g., 
25-SATA. The combination of hex value and tag serves as a unique identifier for each 
drive. The two digit hex value is used by the FS-TST diskwipe program as a sector fill 
value. The FS-TST compare tools, diskcmp and partcmp, count sectors that are filled 
with the source and destination fill values on a destination that is larger than the original 
source.

5 Test Results 
The main item of interest for interpreting the test results is determining the conformance 
of the device with the test assertions. Conformance with each assertion tested by a given 
test case is evaluated by examining the Log Highlights box of the test report.

Summary: 
clone.  
 
Assertions: 
 
AM-01 The tool uses access interface SRC-AI to access the digital source.
 
AM-02 The tool acquires digital source DS.
 
AM-03 The tool executes in execution environment XE. 
AM-04 If clone creation is specified, the tool creates a clone of the 
 
digital source.
 
AM-06 All visible sectors are acquired from the digital source.
 
AM-08 All sectors acquired from the digital source are acquired accurately.
AO-11 If requested, a clone is created during an acquisition of a digital 
 
source. 
AO-13 A clone is created using access interface DST-AI to write to the clone 
 
device. 
AO-14 If an unaligned clone is created, each sector written to the clone is 
accurately written to the same disk address on the clone that the sector
 
occupied on the digital source.
AO-17 If requested, any excess sectors on a clone destination device are not 
 
modified. 
AO-22 If requested, the tool calculates block hashes for a specified block 
 
size during an acquisition for each block acquired from the digital source.
AO-23 If the tool logs any log significant information, the information is 
 
accurately recorded in the log file.
AO-24 If the tool executes in a forensically safe execution environment, the 
 
digital source is unchanged by the acquisition process.

Summary: 
DA-02 Acquire a digital source of type DS to an unaligned clone. 
Assertions: 
AM-01 The tool uses access interface SRC-AI to access the digital source.
AM-02 The tool acquires digital source DS.
AM-03 The tool executes in execution environment XE. 
AM-04 If clone creation is specified, the tool creates a clone of the 
digital source.
AM-06 All visible sectors are acquired from the digital source.
AM-08 All sectors acquired from the digital source are acquired accurately.
AO-11 If requested, a clone is created during an acquisition of a digital 
source. 
AO-13 A clone is created using access interface DST-AI to write to the clone 
device. 
AO-14 If an unaligned clone is created, each sector written to the clone is 
accurately written to the same disk address on the clone that the sector 
occupied on the digital source.
AO-17 If requested, any excess sectors on a clone destination device are not 
modified. 
AO-22 If requested, the tool calculates block hashes for a specified block 
size during an acquisition for each block acquired from the digital source.
AO-23 If the tool logs any log significant information, the information is 
accurately recorded in the log file.
AO-24 If the tool executes in a forensically safe execution environment, the 
digital source is unchanged by the acquisition process.

Case 
 
DA-10 Acquire a digital source to an image file in an alternate format.
 
Summary: 
 
Assertions: 
 
AM-01 The tool uses access interface SRC-AI to access the digital source. 
 
AM-02 The tool acquires digital source DS. 
 
AM-03 The tool executes in execution environment XE.  
AM-05 If image file creation is specified, the tool creates an image file  
 
on file system type FS. 
 
AM-06 All visible sectors are acquired from the digital source. 
 
AM-08 All sectors acquired from the digital source are acquired accurately. 
AO-01 If the tool creates an image file, the data represented by the image  
 
file is the same as the data acquired by the tool. 
AO-02 If an image file format is specified, the tool creates an image file  
 
in the specified format. 
AO-05 If the tool creates a multi-file image of a requested size then all  
 
the individual files shall be no larger than the requested size. 
AO-22 If requested, the tool calculates block hashes for a specified block  
 
size during an acquisition for each block acquired from the digital source. 
AO-23 If the tool logs any log significant information, the information is  
 
accurately recorded in the log file. 
AO-24 If the tool executes in a forensically safe execution environment,  
 
the digital source is unchanged by the acquisition process.

Conseil de l'Europe - Convention sur la cybercriminalité (STE n° 185)
1.   a.    Le présent article s'applique à l'extradition entre les Parties pour les infractions pénales 
définies conformément aux articles 2 à 11 de la présente Convention, à condition qu'elles soient 
punissables dans la législation des deux Parties concernées par une peine privative de liberté pour 
une période maximale d'au moins un an, ou par une peine plus sévère. 
      b.    Lorsqu’il est exigé une peine minimale différente, sur la base d’un traité d’extradition tel 
qu’applicable entre deux ou plusieurs parties, y compris la Convention européenne d’extradition 
(STE n° 24), ou d’un arrangement reposant sur des législations uniformes ou réciproques, c’est la 
peine minimum prévue par ce traité ou cet arrangement qui s’applique.
2. Les infractions pénales décrites au paragraphe 1 du présent article sont considérées comme 
incluses en tant qu’infractions pouvant donner lieu à extradition dans tout traité d’extradition 
existant entre ou parmi les Parties. Les Parties s’engagent à inclure de telles infractions comme 
infractions pouvant donner lieu à extradition dans tout traité d’extradition pouvant être conclu 
entre ou parmi elles.
3. Lorsqu’une Partie conditionne l’extradition à l’existence d’un traité et reçoit une demande 
d’extradition d’une autre Partie avec laquelle elle n’a pas conclu de traité d’extradition, elle peut 
considérer la présente Convention comme fondement juridique pour l’extradition au regard de 
toute infraction pénale mentionnée au paragraphe 1 du présent article.
4. Les Parties qui ne conditionnent pas l’extradition à l’existence d’un traité reconnaissent les 
infractions pénales mentionnées au paragraphe 1 du présent article comme des infractions pouvant 
donner lieu entre elles à l’extradition.
5. L’extradition est soumise aux conditions prévues par le droit interne de la Partie requise ou par 
les traités d’extradition en vigueur, y compris les motifs pour lesquels la Partie requise peut 
refuser l’extradition.
6. Si l’extradition pour une infraction pénale mentionnée au paragraphe 1 du présent article est 
refusée uniquement sur la base de la nationalité de la personne recherchée ou parce que la Partie 
requise s’estime compétente pour cette infraction, la Partie requise soumet l’affaire, à la demande 
de la Partie requérante, à ses autorités compétentes aux fins de poursuites, et rendra compte en 
temps utile de l’issue de l’affaire à la Partie requérante. Les autorités en question prendront leur 
décision et mèneront l’enquête et la procédure de la même manière que pour toute autre infraction 
de nature comparable conformément à la législation de cette Partie.
7.   a.    Chaque Partie communique au Secrétaire général du Conseil de l'Europe, au moment de la 
signature ou du dépôt de son instrument de ratification, d’acceptation, d’approbation ou

Titre 3 – Principes généraux relatifs à l’entraide
Article 25 – Principes généraux relatifs à l’entraide
1. Les Parties s'accordent l'entraide la plus large possible aux fins d'investigations ou de 
procédures concernant les infractions pénales liées à des systèmes et des données informatiques 
ou afin de recueillir les preuves sous forme électronique d’une infraction pénale.
2. Chaque Partie adopte également les mesures législatives et autres qui se révèlent nécessaires 
pour s'acquitter des obligations énoncées aux articles 27 à 35.
3. Chaque Partie peut, en cas d’urgence, formuler une demande d’entraide ou les communications 
s’y rapportant par des moyens rapides de communication, tels que la télécopie ou le courrier 
électronique, pour autant que ces moyens offrent des conditions suffisantes de sécurité et 
d’authentification (y compris le cryptage si nécessaire), avec confirmation officielle ultérieure si 
l’Etat requis l’exige. L’Etat requis accepte la demande et y répond par n’importe lequel de ces 
moyens rapides de communication.
4. Sauf disposition contraire expressément prévue dans les articles du présent Chapitre, l'entraide 
est soumise aux conditions fixées par le droit interne de la Partie requise ou par les traités 
d'entraide applicables, y compris les motifs sur la base desquels la Partie requise peut refuser la 
coopération. La Partie requise ne doit pas exercer son droit de refuser l’entraide concernant les 
infractions visées aux articles 2 à 11 au seul motif que la demande porte sur une infraction qu’elle 
considère comme de nature fiscale.
5. Lorsque, conformément aux dispositions du présent chapitre, la Partie requise est autorisée à 
subordonner l'entraide à l'existence d'une double incrimination, cette condition sera considérée 
comme satisfaite si le comportement constituant l'infraction, en relation avec laquelle l'entraide 
est requise, est qualifié d'infraction pénale par son droit interne, que le droit interne classe ou non 
l'infraction dans la même catégorie d'infractions ou qu’il la désigne ou non par la même 
terminologie que le droit de la Partie requérante.
Article 26 – Information spontanée
1. Une Partie peut, dans les limites de son droit interne et en l’absence de demande préalable, 
communiquer à une autre Partie des informations obtenues dans le cadre de ses propres enquêtes 
lorsqu’elle estime que cela pourrait aider la Partie destinataire à engager ou à mener à bien des 
enquêtes ou des procédures au sujet d’infractions pénales établies conformément à la présente

Convention, ou lorsque ces informations pourraient aboutir à une demande formulée par cette 
Partie au titre du présent chapitre.
2. Avant de communiquer de telles informations, la Partie qui les fournit peut demander qu’elles 
restent confidentielles ou ne soient utilisées que sous certaines conditions. Si la Partie destinataire 
ne peut faire droit à cette demande, elle doit en informer l’autre Partie, qui devra alors déterminer 
si les informations en question devraient néanmoins être fournies. Si la Partie destinataire accepte 
les informations aux conditions prescrites, elle sera liée par ces dernières.

similaire ou la divulgation des données peut, pour des infractions autres que celles établies 
conformément aux articles 2 à 11 de la présente Convention, se réserver le droit de refuser la 
demande de conservation au titre du présent article dans le cas où elle a des raisons de penser 
qu’au moment de la divulgation, la condition de double incrimination ne pourra pas être remplie.
5. En outre, une demande de conservation peut être refusée uniquement :
a. si la demande porte sur une infraction que la Partie requise considère comme étant de 
nature politique ou liée à une infraction de nature politique ; ou
a. si la Partie requise estime que le fait d’accéder de la demande risquerait de porter 
atteinte à sa souveraineté, à sa sécurité, à l’ordre public ou à d’autres intérêts essentiels.

disponibilité future des données, compromettra la confidentialité de l’enquête de la Partie 
requérante ou nuira d’une autre façon à celle-ci, elle en informe rapidement la Partie requérante, 
qui décide alors s’il convient néanmoins d’exécuter la demande.

Group on Imaging Technology (SWGIT), Section 7 Best Practices for Forensic Video Analysis.) 
1. 
Introduction 
Forensic Video Analysis (FVA) is defined as the scientific examination, comparison, and/or 
evaluation of video in legal matters.  
Organizations may utilize different titles for the personnel who perform FVA (e.g., analyst, 
examiner, practitioner, scientist). For the purpose of this document, personnel performing FVA 
will be referred to as an “analyst.” 
The purpose of this document is to provide forensic video analysts with recommendations on the 
handling and examination of video evidence to successfully introduce such evidence in a court of 
law. These guidelines may also be used to assist organizations when developing standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) for the processing of video evidence. Organizations should align 
the best practices in this document to ensure they adhere to governmental and local laws, 
regulations, and SOPs.  
For the purposes of this document, the word “image” refers to a representation of a subject or 
object derived from video or still photography.  
2. 
Limitations 
This document is not a training manual, nor a step-by-step methodology.  
This document is intended for use by forensic science service providers working in a forensic 
environment. While many of the practices and processing techniques relate, it is not intended to 
be used for the processing of video files as part of criminal investigations strictly for use as an 
“investigative lead” (e.g., BOLO, wanted poster). For the purpose of this document, an 
investigative lead is any piece of information that should not be used as a sole source of charging 
decision or submission in court. 
This document does not address the acquisition of digital and multimedia evidence. For more 
information on data acquisition from DVRs, see SWGDE Best Practices for Data Acquisition 
from Digital Video Recorders [1]. For more information of data acquisition from cloud storage, 
see SWGDE Best Practices for Digital & Multimedia Evidence Video Acquisition from Cloud 
Storage [2]. 
This document does not address the analysis of analog media; for more information on legacy 
options, see SWGIT Section 7 Best Practices for Forensic Video Analysis [3].  
3. 
General Tasks 
The process of FVA can involve several different tasks, regardless of the type of analysis 
performed. These tasks fall into three categories: technical preparation, examination, and 
interpretation. The general principles and procedures used in these tasks are the same regardless 
of the format in which the images/videos are recorded.

3.1 
Technical Preparation 
Technical preparation is the performance of tasks in advance of examination, analysis, or 
output. There are a multitude of technical decisions within the various tasks. Technical 
preparation will affect further stages of the analysis. Tasks may include the following: 
creating working copies, integrity verification, write protection, organization of files, and 
playback optimization.  
3.2 
Examination 
Examination is the application of imaging science expertise to extract technical information 
from video. Examples may include the following: metadata collection, macroblock analysis, 
format conversion, timeline sequence reconstruction, and pattern or video frame information 
analysis utilizing a tool such as a hexadecimal viewer. Examination tasks also include image 
and video clarification, frame averaging, video stabilization, synchronization, and other 
video processing activities intended to improve the visual appearance of features in a video. 
3.2.1 Types of Examinations  
a) Metadata collection: The use of software tools to analyze embedded data 
contained in video files. 
b) Format conversion: The use of software to convert video file formats for 
examination, analysis, and/or playback. 
c) Timeline sequence reconstruction: The process of relating video, images, audio, 
or other data to one another in a chronologically ordered succession. Analysts 
should be aware that synchronizing multimedia files with different video 
properties, if not properly accounted for, may result in a drift in synchronization.  
d) Speed or motion analysis: The determination of an object’s speed and/or 
direction using frame information from the recorded video.  
e) Pattern or video frame information analysis: The use of a video’s visual cues 
and/or metadata to examine specific information relative to individual frames of 
video (e.g., display order, display timing, identification of key frames).  
f) 
Macroblock analysis: The understanding and/or visualization of original video 
data and predicted information contained within individual video frames.  
g) Video frame extraction: Accurately producing individual, or a group of, still 
images from recorded video while maintaining technical attributes as well as 
visual content. 
h) Video clarification: The use of techniques and adjustments to provide insight and 
information related to the visual data of a video frame. This can include pattern or 
noise removal, frame averaging, levels adjustments, stabilization, interpolation, 
and edge sharpening. 
i) 
Comparison: The analysis of video to extract individual frames and prepare 
images for comparison. This type of examination can be applied to objects or 
persons for identification purposes. It requires proper training and a comparison 
methodology. For more information, refer to SWGDE Best Practices for 
Photographic Comparison for All Disciplines [4].

j) 
Recovery or reconstitution of video files: The applied knowledge of video file, 
codec, and frame information to recover video not available through traditional 
means. 
3.3 
Interpretation 
For purposes of this document, interpretation in video analysis is the application of specific 
subject matter expertise to draw conclusions about video recordings or the content of those 
recordings produced in the examination. Content-based interpretations fall under the 
discipline of Image Analysis as applied to video images. For further information on Image 
Analysis, refer to SWGDE Guidelines for Forensic Image Analysis [5]. Interpretation can 
include statements pertaining to video attributes determined during the examination (e.g., 
reliability of images seen in temporally compressed frames). 
NOTE: “Technical preparation, “Examination,” and “Interpretation” are tasks, not job 
descriptions or roles. An individual may perform part of one task or a combination of 
multiple tasks within the organizational structure of any given activity. Additionally, not all 
requests require the use of all three tasks. Each of these tasks requires its own training and 
qualifications.  
4. 
Workflow 
The following describes a generalized workflow for the analysis of video evidence. These 
recommendations represent specific considerations to be addressed by the analyst. The exact 
sequence will be dependent upon the evidence submitted and the required examinations. 
4.1 
Review Request for Analysis 
a) A submission form should be completed for every case the analyst receives, regardless 
of what type of examination or service the requestor is seeking. See Appendix A for an 
example. 
i) 
In exigent circumstances, it may be acceptable to obtain a verbal request for 
examination or service; however, a formal request should be completed prior to 
any final examination results being reported. 
b) Review the request for analysis and ensure the organization is able to fulfill the request. 
c) The organization must ensure the requestor has submitted all items needed to support 
the requested analysis or examination.  
NOTE: In some cases, it may be necessary for the organization to obtain additional items or 
information before the analysis can be started/completed. This may require the submission 
of additional items or an in-person meeting or phone conference.  
d) Efforts should be made to obtain pertinent information regarding the recording device, 
if not previously provided by the requestor (e.g., manufacturer, make, model). 
e) The organization must verify that it has the necessary equipment, materials, and 
resources needed to conduct the requested analysis.  
f) 
The request for analysis must be assigned to the appropriate personnel. 
g) Ensure that no other prior examination is required. In situations where video evidence 
requires additional forensic analyses, the video analyst should consult with qualified

examiners (e.g., latent prints, DNA) to determine the proper sequence of examinations 
to maximize the evidentiary value of the submitted evidence. Analysts should follow 
organizational policy to minimize cross-contamination or destruction of physical 
evidence. 
h) Depending on the organization’s SOPs, if a prior analysis on the same evidence has 
been performed, there may be a specialized process for submitting a request for 
additional analysis.  
4.2 
Technical Preparation 
4.2.1 Physical Inspection of the submitted media 
a) The evidence submitted with the request should be inspected prior to analysis to 
ensure that the physical items match those described on the submission form. 
Care should be taken based on any safety precautions or special handling 
identified in the request for analysis.  
b) Document and photograph the physical condition of the evidence.  
c) Inspect the items for physical damage that may impact the proper function of the 
media or device. 
d) If damaged, document and photograph the condition in which the item was 
received (e.g., scratches and cracks on optical media, the presence of 
contaminants or water damage).  
e) Follow organizational policies and procedures for documentation and repair 
processes. 
f) 
Electronically submitted evidence should address authentication and data integrity 
and follow organizational procedures.  
g) Electronically submitted evidence should be downloaded immediately and 
transferred to a more permanent means of storage. Refer to SWGDE Best 
Practices for Digital & Multimedia Evidence Video Acquisition from Cloud 
Storage for additional guidance [2].  
4.2.2 Evidence Labeling 
a) Evidence should be labeled per organizational policy. Labeling may include 
initials, case number, item number, or any other identifying information required 
by the analyst’s organization. 
b) Any identifying information (e.g., brand, storage capacity, serial numbers) should 
be documented.  
c) Labeling should not cover any identifying information, integral components, or 
existing labels.  
4.2.2.1 Optical Media 
a) The ideal method for labeling optical media (e.g., BD-R, DVD-R, CD-R) 
is with a non-solvent based felt-tip permanent marker designed to mark 
optical media.

Page 8 of 18 
i) 
Labeling should be made on the clamping ring, which is the clear 
inner portion, as no data information is recorded in that area. 
Inappropriate labeling methods may affect playback and could 
potentially damage the evidence. 
ii) Never use a ballpoint pen, pencil, or other sharp writing instrument 
when marking optical media.  
iii) Do not use adhesive labels on optical media. 
4.2.2.2 Hard disk drives and Flash Media    
a) Label the physical media directly, when possible.  
b) If the media is too small for labeling (e.g., microSD card, flash drive), the 
media should be placed in an appropriate container with the information 
required by the analyst’s organization displayed. 
4.2.3 Write Protection 
a) Digital media must be treated in such a manner to prevent modification of the 
content. 
b) The use of write blockers, either hardware or software based, should be utilized 
for flash media and hard disk drives (HDD). Digital media should be accessed as 
read-only or utilizing write-protecting mechanisms to ensure that data cannot be 
altered.  
i) 
If the device is accessed as read-write, the reason shall be documented. 
c) When utilizing hardware write protection, the analyst should be aware that the 
flash media serial number displayed may be the serial number of the write-
protection hardware and not the flash media itself. 
4.2.4 Creation of a Working Copy and Verification 
a) Create a working copy of the original submitted evidence.  
b) Steps should be taken to ensure the integrity of the data acquired; this should 
include computing a hashing algorithm on the original submitted evidence and the 
working copy. Compare the two hash results to ensure that they are identical and 
that no changes have occurred during the copy process. 
4.2.5 Verify Proprietary Player Operability 
a) If a proprietary player is required to view the video, ensure operating system 
compatibility and codec functionality. 
4.3 
Examination 
4.3.1 Media Interrogation 
Media interrogation involves the examination of the technical aspects of a multimedia 
file to ascertain its display attributes (e.g., display resolution, pixel aspect ratio, frame 
rate, codec). 
a) Interrogate the file to determine recording properties.

Page 9 of 18 
b) There are several open source and commercial tools available for file 
interrogation. A comparison of file interrogation results from multiple sources is 
recommended. Any discrepancies in the reported results should be documented 
and evaluated.  
c) Compare these results to those documented when the video files were acquired, if 
available. See SWGDE Best Practices for Data Acquisition from Digital Video 
Recorders for additional information [1].  
4.3.2 Review 
a) The video files submitted for analysis should be reviewed to ensure that the file is 
an accurate representation of the video described in the request for examination. 
Any observed discrepancies with the information in the submitted request should 
be documented. 
b) If the recording is a screen copy, has been previously processed, or was recovered 
in a manner such that the original metadata is not present (e.g., a recording 
streamed to a portable DVD writer, a monitor screen captured with a mobile 
device’s video camera, transcoded to an open file format) contact the requestor to 
determine if the native file is available. If the native file is not submitted or 
available, document the status of the native file, the known facts of the evidence 
provided, and inform the requester of any limitations imposed on the examination. 
c) A preliminary determination should be made with respect to the feasibility of the 
requested task(s) (e.g., clarification, comparison, conversion).  
d) When identifying the area of interest for analysis, the following should be 
considered: 
i) 
Whether there is information outside the area of interest that provides 
additional details relevant to the analysis.  
NOTE: Consider consulting with the requester to possibly expand the scope 
of the request.  
ii) 
Details about the incident not directly related to the request that may be 
present. These include: 
1) 
Images which could verify the time and/or place of the incident, such 
as clocks, street signs, scoreboards, and dispatch time when 
responding units arrive. 
2) 
Potential witnesses or bystanders. 
NOTE: Analysts should be aware that audio may be present within video 
recordings.  
NOTE: Care should be given to information that could create a cognitive bias for 
the analyst. 
4.3.3 Processing, Clarification, and Examination 
a) Any processing performed on the video files should be completed on the working 
copy and sufficiently documented so that the methods can be reproduced and 
independently evaluated. This documentation should include the order and

Version: 1.0 (November 20, 2018) 
This document includes a cover page with the SWGDE disclaimer. 
Page 10 of 18 
settings in which the processes were applied to ensure the integrity and the 
reproducibility of the results.  
b) If possible, the video files should be imported into any processing, clarification, 
and/or examination tool in the native format. See SWGDE Technical Overview of 
Digital Video Files for more information [6]. 
i) 
Importing video files into software may require a conversion. Steps to 
preserve the original video codec should be taken, such as changing the file 
container while keeping the original video codec.  
NOTE: While the video frame information may stay intact, additional file 
metadata will be lost by changing the file container.  
ii) 
Should changing the container not produce a file for processing, steps can 
be made to transcode to a lossless codec. See SWGDE Technical Notes for 
FFmpeg for a list of processes [7]. Transcoding could affect the content of a 
video file by changing its visual appearance, however small. Avoid 
degradation of the video by limiting unnecessary conversions. 
iii) 
If no other option is available or appropriate, capturing the output of a 
proprietary player into an open file for processing is possible (sometimes 
referred to as screen capture). Care should be taken to ensure the resultant 
file stays consistent with the source material’s recording properties (e.g., 
frame rate, frame count, resolution, aspect ratio). 
c) Identify the appropriate tool(s) to clarify the recording/image. The process of 
selecting tools should be done by looking for technical concerns within the video 
that can be corrected.  
i) 
Initial corrections should be those that account for the input file structure as 
it was recorded. These would include corrections for aspect ratio, 
understanding of compression artifacts, noise as it relates to chroma 
subsampling, frame rate, and file resolution. An understanding of these 
aspects can be found in SWGDE’s Technical Overview of Digital Video 
Files [6]. 
ii) 
The analyst should then make corrections regarding the camera the video 
was recorded with. These can include issues with focus, luminance, focal 
length, and camera location. 
iii) 
Once the technical concerns within the recording are resolved regarding the 
file structure and the camera, the analyst can address specific details within 
the area of interest. These can include noise removal (e.g., frame averaging, 
Fournier pattern removal), sharpening, and local adjustments. 
iv) 
Specific information and additional recommendations related to 
video/image clarifications may be found in the SWGIT document Best 
Practices for Documenting Image Enhancement [8]. 
d) Assess the clarified file and determine if it yielded the best result(s).

4.4 
Interpretation 
4.4.1 Conclusions 
The analyst may be asked to render an opinion or conclusion regarding the evidence 
based on the scope of the request. The conclusion should answer the question posed by 
the requestor as it relates to the evidence or results of the analysis. In instances where 
the conclusion cannot definitively answer the question being asked, an answer of 
“inconclusive” may be the only appropriate response. In instances where a quantitative 
response is required, a margin of error may be expected, based on the frame 
information and compression of the images. The results of any FVA, regardless of 
scope, should be included in an analyst’s report.  
4.4.2 Reporting 
a) Results should be properly reported in accordance with an organization’s SOPs. 
i) 
Reports should include the requestor, items of evidence, case number, 
agency case number (if different), results, and conclusions, if applicable. 
4.4.3 Technical and Administrative Review  
4.4.3.1 Technical Review 
a) Efforts should be made to have a comparably trained analyst 
independently review the results of the analysis, including conclusions 
drawn.  
b) Organizational SOPs should include the scope, frequency, and method of 
documentation for technical reviews. SOPs should also address the 
qualifications of the technical reviewer.  
c) An organization’s SOPs should include a course of action if an analyst and 
the technical reviewer do not agree.  
4.4.3.2 Administrative Review 
a) An organization’s SOPs should include protocols for administrative 
review.  
b) The administrative review may be a supervisor, the technical reviewer, or 
a third party. 
5. 
Delivery of Examination Results 
The type of output (clarified video, still images, charts, or a combination) is dependent on what 
best illustrates the content, quality, and events to be depicted in the final product. Consider the 
intended use of examination results and the quality of the output for playback and courtroom 
presentation. 
Analysts should choose a format that preserves the quality of the clarified recording and meets 
the needs of the requestor. Consider using an uncompressed format, when applicable. If a 
compressed format is requested or required, it should be noted in the documentation and the 
consequences of that choice should be explained to the requestor.

Page 12 of 18 
Any labeling added to the output media, such as agency logos, text, case information, or analyst 
initials should not obscure the pertinent area(s). 
5.1 
Storage Media  
a) Examination results should be output to write-once media, where appropriate, (e.g., BD-
R, DVD-R, CD-R). Rewritable optical media (e.g., DVD-RW, CD-RW) should not be 
used. 
b) In situations where the analyst is responsible for the acquisition, preservation, 
processing, and analysis of video evidence it may be appropriate to store the original 
and resultant multimedia evidence onto one storage device.  
c) A hard disk drive or other media may be utilized in accordance with the organization’s 
SOPs.  
d) A hash should be performed on the results media and stored with the case file.  
5.2 
Print-Outs 
a) Durability, longevity, and quality of printed images produced should be considered. 
Whenever possible, the printer manufacturer’s recommendation for ink, paper, storage, 
maintenance, and settings should be followed.  
b) The most important aspect of printing is that the printed still image file remain a true 
and accurate representation of the original event. For this reason, considerations should 
be made to ensure aspect ratios, resolution, and color balance is consistent between 
digital and printed images. 
c) Some clarified results may be best displayed digitally instead of in a printed format and 
should be documented when this is the case.  
i) 
Printed reports may lose interactions that the analyst intended (e.g., embedded 
video, hyperlinks).  
5.3 
Verification 
Examination results should be verified to check that all content was transferred successfully 
and that the quality of the output accurately reflects the results of the analysis.  
a) A post-examination hash value should be generated and documentation of the 
examination results to aid in verifying data integrity at a future point.  
b) The analyst should be aware that there may be compatibility issues between the 
examination results and the ability to play video files in the future.  
c) After verification, the original media and all examination results should be properly 
labeled, packaged, and sealed in accordance with an organization’s SOPs. 
6. 
Archiving 
Case files, including examination results, should be archived in accordance with an 
organization’s SOPs.

7. 
Additional Considerations 
7.1 
Standard Operating Procedures 
Organizations should have SOPs for the handling, transportation, documentation, and 
storage of evidence for the analysis being performed. The SOPs should be organization 
specific, reflect the workflow, and be general enough to permit flexibility for the required 
tasks. 
7.1.1 Evidence Management 
Organizations should ensure that the evidence is safely stored, maintained, transferred, 
etc. to guarantee that the integrity of the evidence remains unchanged.  
7.1.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
Organizational SOPs should provide planned and systematic actions necessary to 
provide sufficient confidence that the organization's product or service will satisfy 
given requirements for quality. These should include technical review, administrative 
reviews, validations, performance verifications, etc. 
7.1.3 Security 
There should be procedures in place to maintain the security of the working data, all 
notes, and other analysis related materials. For example, case related materials should 
be stored in a manner that limits access. The degree of access will be organization 
specific. 
7.1.4 Virus Scan 
a) Virus scanning should be performed in accordance with organizational policies 
and procedures.  
b) The specific methods and software applications used for virus scanning, and 
remedial actions if a virus is found, will be determined by individual 
organizations. This should be documented within an organization’s SOPs. 
c) Considerations should be made for utilizing a virtual machine for any executable 
files or those that could make any changes or alter the local workstation. A virtual 
machine can serve to protect the host system from any potential malware or 
inadvertent system changes that can affect other casework. 
7.1.5 Chain of Custody 
a) The chain of custody is the chronological documentation of the movement, 
location, possession, and disposition of evidence.  
b) Organizations should have chain of custody procedures in place throughout the 
entire FVA process and should follow these procedures to ensure the integrity, 
and authentication of the data. 
7.2 
Infrastructure 
Organizations should have sufficient space, equipment, privacy, security, and facilities to 
adequately support the required quality and volume of work.

Version: 1.0 (November 20, 2018) 
This document includes a cover page with the SWGDE disclaimer. 
Page 14 of 18 
7.3 
Validation/Confirmation Testing of Tools 
Organizations should have SOPs that address validation and/or verification of software and 
hardware. Hardware used should meet the developers’ minimum specifications. 
Consideration should be given to archiving previous software versions, builds, and operating 
systems for processing video evidence from legacy digital video recorder systems and other 
sources of video.  
7.4 
Documentation 
a) Notes should be contemporaneous with the examination process to document how 
evidence was handled and what processes were performed.  
b) The application of analytical techniques in a given case should be recorded to the 
degree that a similarly trained analyst would be able to replicate the techniques and 
reach a comparable analytical conclusion.  
c) Documentation may be accomplished through handwritten or electronically generated 
notes, photographs, photocopies, screenshots, and automated tool reports. 
7.5 
Training, Competency, and Proficiency 
Organizations and Forensic Video Analysts are encouraged to review SWGDE Training 
Guidelines for Video Analysis, Image Analysis and Photography and SWGDE Proficiency 
Test Guidelines [9] [10]. 
7.5.1 Training 
a) Analysts should have sufficient training in their knowledge domain and associated 
forensic discipline. Sufficient training can be determined by a certifying body or 
an analyst’s organization.  
b) Certification is one method to evaluate competency. Certifications can be 
comprehensive, tool-based, or topic-specific and can be an additional tool in 
verifying technical skills and abilities. Comprehensive certifications generally 
require training be completed, a specified amount of experience in the discipline, 
and the successful completion of an examination. Certifications can be beneficial 
and should be considered when appropriate.  
i) 
Most certifications require additional training to be maintained or further 
testing for certification to be renewed. 
7.5.2 Competency and Proficiency 
Analysts should demonstrate competency in their discipline prior to being assigned 
unsupervised case work responsibilities. Analysts should maintain competency 
through continuing education, training, successful proficiency testing, and peer review 
of examinations. Organizations and analysts should document training, competency, 
proficiency, and continuing education. 
Analysts should demonstrate: 
a) An understanding of the scope of work and how it will be applied in the forensic 
environment.

b) Subject matter knowledge and competence. 
i) 
Knowledge of image and/or video processing and evaluation techniques. 
ii) 
Knowledge of image and/or video compression standards and technologies. 
iii) 
Knowledge of applications and tools utilized in the specific organization. 
iv) 
Knowledge of SWGDE and SWGIT guidelines for capturing, storing, and 
processing image/video, including topics such as data integrity and 
compression artifacts. 
v) 
Understanding of legal precedent for the use of specific image and/or video 
processing techniques. 
vi) 
Knowledge of appropriate case work documentation and ability to follow 
organizational SOPs. 
c) Analysts should have available documentation that describes and justifies the use 
of any method involved in the analysis. Such documentation can include peer-
reviewed journal articles, scientific conference proceedings, reference books, 
internal white papers, or internal/external validations.

Introduction 
The Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) program is a joint project of the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), 
the National Institute of Justice, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Special Program Office and Information Technology Laboratory. CFTT is supported by 
other organizations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department 
of Defense Cyber Crime Center, U.S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation 
Division Electronic Crimes Program, and the DHS Bureau of Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Secret Service. The objective 
of the CFTT program is to provide measurable assurance to practitioners, researchers, 
and other applicable users that the tools used in computer forensics investigations provide 
accurate results. Accomplishing this requires the development of specifications and test 
methods for computer forensics tools and subsequent testing of specific tools against 
those specifications. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Test results provide the information necessary for developers to improve tools, users to 
make informed choices, and the legal community and others to understand the tools’ 
capabilities. The CFTT approach to testing computer forensics tools is based on well- 
recognized methodologies for conformance and quality testing. Interested parties in the 
computer forensics community can review and comment on the specifications and test 
methods posted on the CFTT Website (https://www.cftt.nist.gov/). 
This document reports the results from testing Axiom v3.9.0.18130 decoding and 
analysis of mobile devices JTAG and Chip-Off binaries. 
Test results from other tools can be found on the DHS S&T-sponsored digital forensics 
webpage, https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/nist-cftt-reports. 
Thanks and appreciation to Rex Kiser and his team from the Fort Worth Police 
Department – Digital Forensics Lab and Steve Watson and his team from VTO Labs for 
their assistance on performing Chip-Off data extractions.

4 Test Results 
This section provides the test case results reported by the tool. Sections 4.1 – 4.2 identify 
the make and model of the mobile device used for creating the binary image and data 
extraction technique employed i.e., Chip-Off, JTAG. 
The Test Cases column in sections 4.1 and 4.2 are comprised of two sub-columns that 
define a test category and individual sub-categories that are verified when decoding 
and analyzing the associated binary image. The results are as follows: 
As Expected: the mobile forensic application returned expected test results – the tool 
parsed and extracted supported data objects from the JTAG, Chip-Off binary 
successfully. 
Partial: the mobile forensic application returned some of data from the JTAG, Chip-Off 
binary. 
Not As Expected: the mobile forensic application failed to return expected test results – 
the tool did not acquire or report supported data from the JTAG, Chip-Off binary 
successfully. 
NA: Not Applicable – the mobile forensic application is unable to perform the test, or 
the tool does not provide support for the acquisition for a particular data element.

4.1 Chip-Off Data Extractions 
The internal memory contents for Chip-Off binary images were decoded and analyzed 
with Axiom v3.9.0. 
 
 
 
 
 
All test cases pertaining to the acquisition of supported Android devices were successful 
except for the following: 
 Twitter social media data was partially reported i.e., account related information. 
(Device: LG K7) 
Notes: 
-Devices defined in the table below with an ‘*’ e.g., HTC One XL*, both Chip-Off and 
JTAG data extractions were performed. 
-When performing the Chip-Off data extraction, it appeared the HTC One Mini had 
suffered water damage, which may lead to differences in the data reported for the JTAG 
compared to Chip-Off. 
 Deleted Contacts, Calendar, Memo/Note entries were recovered for the HTC 
Desire 626, ZTE 970, Samsung S2, HTC One XL, Samsung S4, and HTC 
One Mini. 
 Deleted Contacts and Calendar entries were recovered for the LG K7 and 
HTC Desire S. 
 Deleted Call logs were recovered for the LG K7, ZTE 970, Samsung S2, HTC 
One XL, Samsung S4, HTC One Mini, and HTC Desire S. 
 Deleted SMS entries were recovered for the HTC Desire 626, LG K7, ZTE 970, 
Samsung S2, HTC One XL, Samsung S4, HTC One Mini, and HTC Desire S. 
 Deleted bookmark entries were recovered for the HTC Desire 626, ZTE 970, 
Samsung S2, HTC One XL, Samsung S4, HTC One Mini, and HTC Desire 
S.

Acknowledgements  
 
The Guidelines are based on the Electronic Evidence Guide of the Council of Europe, on the Digital 
Evidence Collection Certificate Manual of the National Center of Excellence in Cybersecurity in Spain 
(INCIBE), and other best practice guides of law enforcement agencies concerning the seizure and 
treatment of electronic evidence. The INTERPOL Innovation Centre Digital Forensics Laboratory (IC 
DFL) also received feedback from digital forensic experts from different parts of the world, to meet a 
consensus for some of the debated or troublesome aspects encountered by digital forensic first 
responders. We wish to mention and thank the following colleagues below, whose valuable input has 
helped to improve the agencies worldwide: 
 
BRAZIL: National Institute of Criminalistics Brazilian Federal Police;  
 
SPAIN: Cybercrime Unit, General Commissary of Criminal Police (CGPJ) of Spanish National 
Police (CNP);  
 
The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) 
 
INTERPOL would also like to express its sincere gratitude to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
for their support and contribution in the creation of the Guidelines.  
The Guidelines will be referenced during an online training activity (Nov-Dec 2020), conducted in the 
framework of INTERPOL Project LEADER; a three-year capacity building initiative funded by the 
Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The project focuses on enhancing digital forensics capacities of 
beneficiaries’ in the South and Southeast Asia region. Through such endeavours, key stakeholders’ of 
the project including digital forensic first responders and their law enforcement institutions will have 
the opportunity to strengthen their knowledge on the best practices articulated herein. Moreover, 
the guidelines will also serve the purpose as an invaluable reference tool across all INTERPOL member 
countries ensuring that advice on the handling, collecting and preservation of digital evidence to

Foreword 
 
In pursuit of providing guidance and support to law enforcement agencies across the globe, the 
INTERPOL Innovation Centre (IC) developed the INTERPOL Guidelines for Digital Forensics First 
Responders: Best Practices for Search and Seizure of Electronic and Digital Evidence. I am pleased to 
present these Guidelines which aim to establish best practices for handling and using digital evidence 
during search and seizure preparatory and execution stages. Key technical considerations are also 
identified on the effective preservation of data to ensure that it can support law enforcement in 
criminal investigations and it can be admissible in court. This guide is intended to assist law 
enforcement officers from different crime areas who may attend to a crime scene, being responsible 
for collecting, securing, and transporting electronic and digital evidence. It will also be helpful for 
supervisors of aforementioned officers in guiding and supporting them. Moreover, it can be useful for 
prosecutors to get a better understanding of collection and handling of evidence. 
As our society becomes increasingly integrated with digital technology encompassing every facet of 
our daily lives and law enforcement work, it may be difficult to remember an occasion where you had 
limited interaction with a digital device. For today’s law enforcement community, there is a 
continuous trend towards investigations relying on some form of digital evidence. While we would 
consider that digital evidence indeed shares similar aspects when compared to traditional forms of 
evidence, there are also unique considerations to be taken into account.  
The intangible nature of data obtained in electronic form, its volatility, and the ease at which it can be 
altered, all pose challenges to the integrity of digital evidence. Thus, it is vital that first responders and 
law enforcement practitioners are able to properly identify and handle digital evidence ensuring that 
the latter stages of the digital forensic process can be performed on the basis of sound judgement. 
I am grateful for the contribution of the IC team, particularly its Digital Forensics Laboratory (DFL) for 
sharing their knowledge and subject matter expertise. I also extend my thanks to our colleagues from 
the INTERPOL Capacity Building and Training Directorate (CBT) who have supported this initiative and 
will utilize the Guidelines in the context of projects focused on enhancing digital forensic capabilities. 
Finally, I would like to thank the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its generous support.  
The Guidelines are a reflection of INTERPOL’s sustained efforts in fostering international police 
cooperation and our commitment to assist our member countries in response to the complex global 
security challenges in the digital domain.

SEARCH AND SEIZURE OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE 
 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
This guide aims to offer support and advice to Digital Forensic practitioners from law enforcement 
during the activities of search and seizure for identification and handling of electronic evidence 
through methods that guarantee their integrity. 
An electronic device should not be seized without due preconditions. It is the investigation team 
together with the digital forensic experts that will assist in the collection and processing of electronic 
evidence, who will determine whether it is relevant or not to obtain and process those electronic 
devices. 
Electronic evidence, like all other traditional evidence, must be carefully manipulated so that they can 
be incorporated as evidence in the judicial process. This affects both the physical integrity of the 
devices and the information or data contained therein. It must be taken into consideration that some 
electronic devices require specific procedures for collecting, packing and transporting, either because 
they are susceptible to damage by electromagnetic fields or because they may suffer changes in their 
contents during handling and preservation. 
It should be taken in consideration that the possibility of obtaining traditional (non-electronic) 
evidence from the investigated scenario should not be excluded and that it could be relevant both for 
the investigation and for the subsequent treatment of electronic evidence. This is the case of any 
annotation related to the use of passwords, settings, email accounts, etc. These pieces of evidence 
must be manipulated according to the established procedures to preserve and assure their probative 
value. 
2. SEARCH AND SEIZURE PREPARATION PHASE 
2.1. Planning 
Digital data is a fundamental pillar for most law enforcement investigations today. With the advent of 
the smartphone, social media and internet personalization with services like Google and Apple, a 
person leaves a digital trail and it is important that the digital trail is captured and analyzed for 
intelligence and evidence relating to the crime. The search and seizure phase is critical as this will 
safeguard the devices and the data held on them. If digital equipment is seized and not handled 
correctly, there will be potential for the data to be lost through deletion by the user, remote wiping 
or manipulation by a third party.  
Suppose a team of police officers together with one or more digital forensic expert(s) have to fulfill 
the order of a prosecutor to enter inside the house of an alleged criminal suspected of a serious crime 
such as murder or robbery. There is a possibility that the suspect, within their devices, such as 
telephones or computers, may hold files or documents that are decisive in resolving the case. These 
devices must therefore be searched and, if deemed suitable for the investigation, seized.

In such cases, before starting any search and seizure activity, a series of considerations must be 
taken into account: 
• A preparatory meeting should be held in order to exchange information between the unit in charge 
of the investigation and the personnel of other specialties that go on a support mission. 
• The intervention on the scene of these specialized units should be prioritized and coordinated, which 
will depend on the specific case under investigation. For example, priority may be given to the action 
of Canine Units for the detection of explosives or DNA sampling collection prior to any other activity. 
It is necessary that the unit carrying out the investigation provides in advance certain information 
needed for the coordination of the various specialists who may participate in the search and seizure. 
In the preparatory meeting regarding the appropriate treatment of electronic evidence, participants 
should assess all the basic information of the case, the details about the search warrant regarding 
electronic evidence or advice on the appropriate terms for the request of the warrant and, finally, 
specify the final destination of the seized goods. 
From the point of view of the collection of digital evidence, it is essential to carefully prepare and plan 
all of the activities that will be carried out, taking into account a series of considerations such as: 
• Nature of crime under investigation. The nature of the crime will determine the forecast of the 
necessary equipment and the preparation of the most appropriate technical procedures for each case.   
For example, for crimes related to child sexual abuse, it is probably necessary to determine, in the 
same act of search and seizure, the possession of this material, so it will be necessary to find evidence 
or obtain the necessary samples (pictures, videos, chat sessions, etc.) “On-site” in an adequate and 
safe way. 
In cases of financial crimes, it is very common to find infrastructure networks with user data stored in 
centralized or cloud servers, so it will be necessary to be clear about what type of electronic 
documentation is being sought, what is the best method to obtain it and where to store the data 
captured from those sources. 
• Suspect’s Technical knowledge. Information about the suspects and their technical ability must be 
collected as they could have protected their equipment or data in some way that could compromise 
the acquisition of the evidence. Encryption systems or automatic data deletion applications make it 
difficult to obtain evidence. 
• Location of data storage. It is not unusual for information to be stored in a place other than the 
physical computer equipment of the suspect. Given this, it is necessary to verify the actual location in 
order to require an additional legal authorization, especially if it is stored in a different jurisdiction, or 
if additional technical equipment is required to ensure the integrity of the evidence. 
All data that is needed to carry out specific actions in relation to the processing of electronic evidence 
should be specified in the search warrant application or relevant procedural requirement prior to 
search and seizure. 
In completing the procedural requirements, the final objectives of the action must be clear and 
specifically, in regard to: 
● The authorization for the seizure 
● Obtaining forensic images (“on-site” or not)  
● Analysis of the devices “on-site”

● Use of applications to obtain access passwords 
● Authorization to change the password of email accounts or social networks, etc. 
Given the number of different case scenarios, we should consider the most appropriate actions to the 
specific case. Although, and in most cases, it is advisable to use expressions that support without any 
doubts the different actions to be performed. For example, “it is requested that the seizure, copying 
and analysis of electronic devices capable of containing information in digital format will be done on-
site.” The extent of precision and specificity that is required will depend on the jurisdiction and its 
legal and procedural frameworks. 
2.2. The final destination of the evidence

The destination of the seized items must be defined before starting any activity of search and seizure. 
Forensic copies, as well as devices that require specific treatment, should be sent to the corresponding 
department/team for processing and analysis. 
For each case, adequate packaging, transport and documentation must be provided to maintain the 
chain of custody that begins during the seizure. 
2.3. Equipment preparation 
It is advisable to have a checklist with the material to be carried to the destination so that one can 
verify that everything needed is available and in good condition. A template is provided below (to be 
customized according to the procedural and legal requirements in the relevant jurisdiction). 
It is crucial to have enough devices where forensic images, clones or data from remote sources will be 
stored. These devices should preferably be brand new or, at least, securely wiped overwriting all of 
the data with a known sequence of characters, usually "00" in hexadecimal, to avoid any possible data 
contamination.

3. SEARCH AND SEIZURE EXECUTION PHASE 
Participant’s safety at the search and seizure is a priority issue. For this purpose, there are specially 
trained units. No one should enter the perimeter without having secured the area. People who are in 
the scene will remain controlled at all times during the operations to avoid any alteration or data 
compromise. 
The technical procedural steps described below are suggested, subject to applicable legal and 
procedural requirements in the country. 
3.1. Secure the scene 
In the case of electronic evidence collection, the aim is to avoid the loss, alteration or destruction of 
any possible evidence. For this, the following measures will be taken: 
• 
Remove and forbid unauthorized personnel from accessing the scene. They must be kept away 
from computers, mobile phones or any other sensitive items, including power supplies. In 
addition, suspects should not be able to communicate with anyone who is not on-site to 
prevent remote data destruction. 
• 
Quickly locate the most obvious elements, computers and mobile phones, especially those 
that are connected to the Internet and those that need special assurance measures to prevent 
data loss. 
• 
Check the existence of wireless networks that allow access and modification of data from 
outside. 
• 
Refuse any help offered from unauthorized personnel in the investigation. 
3.2. Assessment 
After first securing the scene, first responders should make a general assessment of the scenario. This 
includes, having a global idea in quantitative terms of the material that is possible to process, the type 
of processing that is going to be carried out and the costs in equipment and time that will be required. 
This is the best time to produce a photographic report of the scene since in this first phase it will have 
suffered minor contaminations.

Although the traditional method of conducting a search was to maintain a clear order starting with a 
thorough search of a room to continue with the next one, in the processing of electronic evidence it 
becomes difficult to follow that working method. This is due to the fact that obtaining or copying the 
evidence is a slow process that can last for many hours. Therefore, it is crucial to start processing this 
evidence as soon as possible while continuing conventional search and seizure. 
It is worth pointing out that digital devices containing potential evidence may be easily hidden, 
integrated or contained within cupboards or drawers, ( memory cards, mobile phones, etc.) so a 
careful sweep for electronic devices of a crime scene may be required depending on your points to 
prove. 
3.3. Document the scene 
All processes to collect and gather the evidence should be duly documented according to applicable 
procedural and legal requirements. To do this, you must keep an exhaustive record of the location and 
original condition of the devices. 
The following are examples for proper documentation of the scene: 
- 
Laptop computer: evidence number EVI001 
- 
Internal hard drive: evidence number EVI001A 
- 
USB Thumb drive: evidence number EVI001B 
- 
DVD: evidence number EVI001C 
At that moment, the possibility of seizing only devices that contain information can be assessed, 
documenting the effects that have been reviewed but will not be processed. In the previous example, 
the devices that contain data to be analyzed are internal hard disks, thumb drives and DVDs, while the 
laptop without the above elements lacks useful information. It should therefore be avoided to 
transport and store devices that we already know do not provide any data. This option must be 
assessed by a specialist, since the intervened effects may have some kind of technical relationship 
with the device they come from and without which it would not be possible to analyze them. This 
procedure will be discussed more in-depth in the specific procedures. 
For each device, the following data must be documented: 
- 
Type: Computer, hard drive, flash drive, DVD, etc., 
- 
Brand and model 
- 
Storage capacity, indicating if it is MB, GB or TB 
- 
Serial number 
- 
State: Damaged, on, off, etc., 
- 
Location: Stay and specific place 
- 
Security: Access password, PIN 
- 
Comments: Used only by children, not connected to the Internet, etc., 
Finally, any annotation related to the use of passwords, settings, email accounts, etc., as well as the 
SIM cardholders with their ICCID, original PIN and PUK number and any other relevant information 
that may be searched will be searched and documented. They will be used in the subsequent analysis 
of the devices.

3.4. Collection and the handling of digital evidence 
As a general rule the following principles will be applied, but refer to the following sections for specific 
devices: 
a) If the equipment is on, do not turn it off. 
Verify installation of anti-forensic systems: local or remote erasing programs, external access. 
Stop these processes even by pulling the power cable or removing the battery if necessary. 
Isolate the device from the networks to which it is connected unless you are authorized to 
access cloud services.  
Disable screensavers and screen locking in order to prevent the equipment from being 
hibernated or suspended. 
Check if the device has any kind of encryption system running (Bitlocker, FileVault, VeraCrypt, 
PGP Disk, etc.). 
Check if it is connected to power. 
b) If the equipment is turned off, do not turn it on until it is processed with guarantees, as 
further explained later. 
If the local legislation allows it, the suspect's password/pin must be asked and checked if it is correct. 
Even if the device is not fully encrypted, it is important to have the suspect's passwords. The suspect 
might have encrypted a file or used the same pattern in another system. 
The following actions can be performed on the devices: 
● Seizure. The device is simply documented, described and sealed, leaving the decision for 
further analysis to the court or any other rightful authority. No further actions are taken on it 
until it is again unsealed. 
● Generate a forensic copy. For each evidence, apply the specific procedures described in this 
manual. 
The process performed will have to be documented: 
● The procedure used: cloned, image or any other system used. 
● Tool: Hardware duplicator, write blocker, software, etc., 
● Destination location: Destination disk, file with the data obtained from a telephone, etc., 
● HASH: Algorithm used and the signature obtained. 
● Observations: Any incident arising during the copy process. 
3.4.1. Live analysis of powered computers and laptops 
It is necessary to carry out an exhaustive record of all the actions performed, as well as the date and 
time at which they were fulfilled. 
The variety of possible scenarios in a capture procedure requires specific considerations for each of 
them. However, it is advisable to follow a predetermined methodology when it comes to capturing 
volatile data based on its volatility order.

If using a forensic tool at a scene, this must only be carried out by trained personnel and ensure that 
the reason for examining the evidence at the scene is documented and controlled. 
There are some tools specially developed for law enforcement that can help in the live analysis. One 
of them is FiRST, which is a first responder tool part of the FREETOOL project, developed by the Berlin 
State Police (Germany). The purpose of FiRST is to inform the first responder if the machine can be 
powered down. FiRST checks for signs that traditional post mortem forensics may not be successful or 
complete. These signs include the presence of encryption or disk-wiping software, cloud/network 
storage locations, virtualization, etc. If these signs are detected, the first responder is warned of the 
dangers inherent in pulling the plug and advised to contact an expert. For more information consider 
visiting the official page of the project at https://freetool.ucd.ie. 
If a specific tool like FiRST is not available, you could consider the list shown below based on the list 
created by Kuhlee and Völzow (Computer Forensik Hacks, O’Reilly, ISBN 978-3-86899-121-5), aimed at 
facilitating the choice of the most appropriate tool to capture specific fragments of volatile data.

Many of these tools are available on the Microsoft Sysinternals website or in the official Linux 
repositories. 
In the selection of tools, it is necessary to take into account a series of considerations: 
● Tools that have less impact on the system should be used. To capture RAM, for example, in 
order to avoid overwriting data, it is preferable to use a small tool such as "dumpit" than 
another that uses a graphical environment such as "FTK Imager". 
● It is also preferable to use tools that have their own executables and not use those of the 
system under investigation. Likewise, the investigator must be able to motivate in the judicial 
procedure the utility and functionality of the tool. 
● The tools used should only capture volatile information. The data that will be available on the 
hard disk can be analyzed later using the procedural guarantees mentioned. 
● The suspect’s media device should never be used to store the captured information and data. 
This information must be saved on external storage devices. 
● These are processes that can last for several hours. Therefore, it is necessary to verify that no 
energy-saving system will interrupt the capture procedure while active. 
3.4.2. Inability to access information on powered devices 
There are times when the equipment to intervene is turned on and yet it is not possible to access the 
content. It may be the case where the device has entered idle mode or the screensaver is active and 
when leaving this state the device requests credentials or a password to access it. The initial and 
technically simple option is to request that password from the user/owner. In case of refusal, there 
may be several techniques to avoid the loss of volatile data. 
It should be noted that these techniques will be used by qualified personnel and in cases in which it is 
certain that the loss of volatile information implies the possibility of not being able to access the 
contents of the rest of the device when it can be found encrypted. 
In the rest of the cases, the action will be explained in the shutdown of switched-on equipment.

a) “Cold-boot RAM” technique. It is a technique consisting of freezing the RAM with the equipment 
on using liquid nitrogen. Once this is done, the computer is turned off and restarted with its own 
operating system from a CD or pen drive, with tools that manage to dump the RAM. When this 
memory is frozen in the shutdown process, it keeps the data it had. 
This technique is based on research carried out by the University of Princeton 1and might not be 
useful in an operational environment.  
b) Transport the intervened device without turning it off. Another method may be to use portable 
power systems that keep the equipment on until the arrival at the forensic laboratory where it will be 
subsequently treated. 
3.5. Seizure Phase 
 
The record of the search and seizure process usually involves the beginning of the chain of custody of 
the evidence involved. So, it will be necessary to specify the next destination and the person(s) 
responsible for the custody of transfers. This process will be informed by the legal requirements in the 
applicable jurisdiction. 
 3.5.1 Packaging and Transport 
All evidence from a search and seizure must meet the following conditions: 
● Ensure that all the collected material has been properly registered and labelled before 
proceeding to its packaging. 
● When possible, the original packaging will be used to package and transport the seized 
devices. 
● They have to be uniquely identified, through labelling. 
● The label must show whether or not they have been subjected to the cloning/copying process. 
Suitable material must be used for its sealing to avoid possible manipulation of the devices. The seal 
must prevent access to internal elements (hard drives or internal memories) both physically and 
through the connection ports of the equipment. 
Depending on their destination, they will be packaged separately, without mixing them with other 
documentation or other devices. This will facilitate the diligence of the unsealing and acquisition of 
forensic copies or their direct submission to the laboratory. Each package containing electronic 
evidence will have on its exterior the identification that shows the nature and origin of the content. 
The means used for transport and temporary storage must ensure the integrity of the devices 
sufficiently, protecting them from shocks, and from sources of electromagnetic radiation, heat or 
humidity that may damage them. 
4. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
4.1. The forensic copy 
One of the main premises in the forensic analysis process warns that, excluding exceptional cases, an 
examination of the evidence should not be performed using the original device. Therefore, it will be

required to copy or clone the data contained in the original device, to avoid compromising its integrity. 
The forensic experts will then use the imaged/copied data to perform the analysis. 
This copy must be an exact bit-by-bit replica of the original device, regardless of its content. 
This process can be done in two formats: 
a) Device to Device (clone): This can be performed by obtaining an exact bit-by-bit replica of 
an original device in another - previously wiped - device with equal or greater capacity. 
b) Device to File (image): This can be performed by generating one or more files that contain, 
linked together, an identical copy of the original device. The most widespread is "dd" (raw) or 
"E01" formats. 
It is possible to perform these processes through hardware duplicators or through specific software 
installed on forensic computers. Forensic duplicators protect the original device from any writing or 
alteration during the process, and when specific software is used to make forensic copies it is advisable 
to use hardware or software write blockers. 
Advantages of creating image files: 
- 
Allows the copy to be spread in multiple files configurable in size, facilitating its storage and 
subsequent analysis. 
- 
Provides file compression without data loss, in order to save storage space on the destination 
device. 
- 
Allows encryption if needed, in order to provide more security. 
- 
May include case information, data on image creation and verification of the integrity of the 
evidence including the results of the HASH. 
- 
Prevents contamination of the copy. 
These formats can be read directly and more efficiently on the analysis programs. 
4.2. Alternatives to the forensic copy 
There are other scenarios in which it will not always be possible to obtain an exact physical copy, bit 
by bit, of the entire source device, such as the acquisition of files or information from servers, NAS, 
virtual disks or encrypted volumes. 
In these cases, there are other techniques to acquire digital evidence. 
a) Logical copy of volumes. This method is applied, for example, when it is needed to acquire the 
content of an encrypted volume that is being used on a powered computer. To preserve that 
information, a logical copy of the volume will be produced. By making a physical copy of the disk, a 
partition would be obtained that would be unreadable since the data is encrypted. However, the 
logical copy allows the user to acquire the content in the same way the user accesses it. 
b) Logical copy of files. It is performed by generating, using suitable software, a replica of the original 
data after selecting what may be of interest to the investigation. For example, in a business 
environment, we can make a logical copy of the suspect user's folder. The drawback is that the file-
slack space in our copy will be lost, and the metadata of the original file system may not always be 
maintained. 
Making forensic logical copies does not prevent the properties of the evidence from being maintained. 
Whenever it is carried out, use the appropriate tool and method, protect against writing, preserve 


1010101$10101010101010101¥01010101010101€01010101010101¥01010101010101$

22
 
 
metadata as much as possible and use a cryptographic algorithm that allows verifying the integrity of 
the acquired data. 
4.3. HASH function 
The HASH function or summary function is used to verify the integrity of a data set. In other words, it 
is about obtaining its “fingerprint”. 
In the case of electronic evidence, this procedure is applied when making copies of the original 
devices, so that, once the HASH value of the origin and destination has been calculated, they must be 
identical. This process is known as verification. 
This procedure is also used to detect known files within the evidence. There are reliable file databases 
(from the installation of operating systems or other applications), such as those of the NSRL (National 
Software Reference Library) that allow them to be discarded, and other databases with the signatures 
of known files, for example, of child sexual abuse material, which allow investigators to identify, track, 
and even share them amongst law enforcement without the need to distribute the original files. 
It is important to remark that some technologies like SSD are becoming a new challenge when 
considering evidence verification methods. Due to how the SSDs work they can sometimes purge data 
all by themselves even if they are not connected to any interface with only the power on. Alternatives 
to traditional evidence hashing must be considered, such as hashing of logical partition or file hashing.

5. SPECIFIC PROCEDURES 
 
In the previous sections a general procedure has been explained in order to preserve the integrity of 
digital evidence. However, during the search and seizure the Digital Forensic Expert will find many 
devices that require specific procedures due to their nature. It will be due to complexity in terms of 
connection processes for some of them, encryption systems present, large amount of data to be 
extracted or lack of standard extraction tools. 
In the following sections you will find the general guidelines for some of the devices that can 
frequently be found in search and seizure environments. 
 
 
Figure 2: Devices: Smart phones and tablets 
 
5.1. Smartphones - Tablets 
 
Mobile phones have become a primary source of digital forensics as they are always on and are very 
personal to each user. A smartphone such as an Android or Apple device can contain from 16GB to 
1TB of data.  
Also, a mobile handset may contain a SIM CARD and a removable media card if supported. 
Each of these elements are essential to an investigation as they contain data that may enable to either 
identify the owner or understand their activity using the mobile phone. 
With the advent of the smartphone and the introduction of application stores such as Google Play and 
iTunes store, the user can install applications that may allow the handset to utilize new services such 
as online gaming, instant messaging, and file sharing. With each mobile handset, the examiner should 
access the application for investigational value and its relevance to the case and the points to prove, 
subject to applicable procedural and legal requirements in their jurisdiction.

5.1.1. Considerations when securing mobile phone evidence 
Mobile devices present a unique forensic challenge due to rapid changes in technology. There are 
numerous makes and models of mobile devices in use today. Many of these devices use closed source 
operating systems and proprietary interfaces, sometimes making it difficult to extract digital evidence. 
Version specific expertise may be necessary to attain access and may alter workflows listed below. 
Examples encountered are as follows: 
 
Incoming and Outgoing Signals – Attempts should be made to block incoming and outgoing 
signals of a mobile device. A common method includes Radio Frequency (RF) blocking 
containers (e.g., Faraday bag or room). RF signal blocking containers may not always be 
successful. They may drain the battery and failure may result in data alteration. 
 
Cables – Data cables can be unique to a particular device and forensic tool. 
 
Destruction of Data – There are methods to destroy data locally and remotely on a mobile 
device. This is why the device must be isolated from all networks (e.g., carrier, Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth) as soon as possible. Examiners should be cognizant that a mobile operating system 
may have automated processes which will destroy data on power-on, or after a specific 
duration of time, and choose an extraction method or schedule that addresses these 
concerns, where applicable. 
 
Drivers – Conflicts may occur due to existing operating system drivers, proprietary drivers, 
driver version inconsistencies, and vendor-specific drivers. Ability to find proper drivers may 
be difficult. Drivers may be included with a forensic tool or downloaded from a website. 
Drivers may compete for control for the same resource if more than one forensic product is 
installed on the analysis machine. 
 
Dynamic Nature of the Data – Data on active (powered-on) mobile devices is constantly 
changing. There are no write-blocking methods for mobile devices. 
 
Encryption – Data may be stored in an encrypted state preventing access or analysis. 
 
Equipment – Equipment used during examinations may not be the most recent version due 
to a variety of reasons, such as purchasing/budgeting delays or verification requirements of 
hardware, firmware, or software. 
 
Field analysis – Triaging mobile devices is not considered a full examination. However, if 
triage is performed, the device should be protected and isolated from all networks. 
 
Inconsistent Industry Standards – Manufacturers and carriers may use proprietary methods 
to store data (e.g., closed operating systems, proprietary data connections). 
 
Loss of Power – Many mobile devices may lose data or initiate additional security measures 
once powered off. 
 
Passwords – Authentication mechanisms can restrict access to a device and its data. 
Traditional password cracking methods can lead to permanent inaccessibility or destruction 
of data. 
 
Removable Media Cards – Processing media cards while still inside the device poses risks 
(e.g., not obtaining all data including the deleted data, altering date/time stamps). 
 
Identity Module e.g., USIM, CSIM, RUIM Cards – Lack of or removal of an identity module 
may prevent the examiner from accessing data stored on the internal memory of a handset. 
Inserting an identity module from another device may cause loss of data. 
 
Training – The individual collecting, examining, and analyzing a mobile device should be 
trained to preserve and maintain data integrity.

25
 
 
 
Unallocated Data / Deleted Data – Mobile device forensic tools may support only a logical 
acquisition of data that may limit the amount of data that can be recovered. 
 
Document the collection of devices in accordance with organizational guidelines and procedures and 
any applicable laws. Documentation may include a written description or photographs of the 
collection location, the device state (e.g., powered on/off, presence of a passcode), examiner 
interactions with the device, and physical characteristics of each device (e.g., damage, identifying 
information such as make, model, serial number, and any identifying marks, and connections).   
The chain of custody documentation should be contemporaneous to the collection and include a 
description or unique identifier for the evidence, and the date and time of receipt and transfers. The 
record should fully identify each person (e.g., name, title, signature) taking possession of an item. 
 
5.1.2. Mobile Phone Evidence Preservation Process for First Responders 
The following flow charts provide a basic overview of the best practices for preserving evidence when 
seizing particular types of mobile devices and are not meant to be all-encompassing.2 
Circumstances may warrant deviation from the procedures outlined herein. Subjects should not be 
access to the device (e.g., subject applies biometric identifiers or enters a passcode). 
  
 5.1.3 iOS Preservation Process and Flowchart 
iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple exclusively for its mobile hardware, 
including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. The following flowchart details steps that should be taken 
to preserve digital evidence on an iOS device. 
All iPhones utilize hardware and software encryption so if the device has a password/passcode/Face 
ID then the user of the handset must supply the information required to gain access to the handset 
otherwise the forensic lab may not be able to access the handset data.

Figure 4: Flowchart for Apple iOS device evidence acquisition procedure 
The flow chart above is not all-inclusive for all versions of iOS. Version specific expertise may be 
necessary in order to obtain access and may alter the foregoing workflow. If the device is powered on, 
it may contain volatile data, including encryption keys, and should not be turned off. 
A power source should be connected as soon as possible to prevent the device from powering down. 
Be sure to seize the charging cable to keep power to the device. It may be possible to adjust the Display 
Auto-Lock feature to extend the length of time before Auto-Lock is enabled. 
 
If the device is unlocked, the examiner should take steps to prevent its locking such as disabling the 
lock code or repeatedly interacting with the touchscreen. 
Place the device in “Airplane Mode” (by swiping up from the bottom and selecting airplane mode) and 
verify that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are off. If the device cannot be placed in “Airplane Mode”, put it in a 
Faraday bag to prevent network interaction from potentially altering data on the device. Mobile 
devices blocked from connecting to a network will boost power output while trying to obtain a signal. 
This will drain a device’s battery at an accelerated rate. If it is necessary to keep the device powered 
on, connect it to an external power source such as a portable battery pack. Both the mobile device 
and the charging source should be placed inside the Faraday bag. If the charging source is not placed 
in the Faraday bag, the cable can act as an antenna and the device may be able to connect to the 
network. 
If the device is off, leave it off. Collect identifying data about the device, such as model number, carrier 
and unique identifiers that are visible. 
   
 5.1.4 Android Preservation Process and Flowchart 
Android is a Linux-based mobile operating system developed by Google and has the largest install base 
of any mobile operating system. Android is available in many different versions and, unlike iOS, is 
offered on devices manufactured by numerous companies. The following flowchart details steps that 
should be taken to preserve digital evidence on an Android device.

The Android device may utilize hardware and software encryption, so if the device has either a 
password/ passcode/Fingerprint/Face ID, then the user of the handset must supply the information 
required to gain access to the handset otherwise the forensic lab may not be able to access the 
handset-data.

If the device is powered on, it may contain volatile data, including encryption keys, and should not be 
turned off. A power source should be connected as soon as possible to avoid the device powering 
down. Be sure to seize the charging cable to keep power to the device. If the device is unlocked, the 
examiner should take steps to prevent its locking such as disabling the lock code or repeatedly 
interacting with the touchscreen. It may be possible to adjust the Display Screen Timeout feature to 
extend the length of time before Auto-Lock is enabled. 
Place the device in “Airplane Mode” (by swiping down from the top and selecting airplane mode) and 
verify that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are off. In order to give the best chance of accessing the evidence at a 
later date, enable USB debugging, if possible. 
If the device cannot be placed in “Airplane Mode”, follow the same procedure as for Apple devices.  
If the device is off, leave it off. Collect identifying data about the device, such as model number, carrier 
and unique identifiers that are visible. 
 
Figure 7: SIM cards. 
5.1.5 SIM Card 
A SIM / USIM card can contain contact lists, phone calls and SMS messages. A SIM Card may be 
protected by a PIN Code. If the code is attempted 3 times without success, access to the SIM Card is 
locked. To unlock it, you will need the PUK code, which is located on the original SIM cardholder or it 
can be requested from the mobile service provider. In any case, the ICCID (Integrated circuit card) will 
be obtained, which is its serial number. 
 
 
Figure 8: SD Cards. 
5.1.6 Removable Media Card 
If a handset allows the use of a removable memory card, then this card is used for expansion of the 
phone storage capacity. Removable storage is commonplace amongst Android handsets as this allows 
the user to store multimedia such as photographs, movies and music files as well as application data 
or backups of applications or mobile phone content. Removable memory cards can potentially be used 
across multiple handsets over time, depending on user behaviour.

Figure 9: Components of cloud storage. 
5.1.7 Cloud Data 
Both Apple and Android phones require the user to have either a Google Account (Android) or an 
iCloud account (Apple). These cloud services enable the user to backup data to the cloud, as well as 
share their photos, videos and music files. They also make it possible to backup handset user data in 
case the device is lost or it has to be transferred to a new handset. 
5.1.8 Considerations upon Seizure 
Traditional Forensics 
Traditional forensic processes, such as fingerprints or DNA testing, may need to be conducted in order 
to establish a link between a mobile device and its owner or user. If the device is not handled properly 
during preservation and collection, physical evidence can be contaminated and rendered useless. As 
such, handle all potentially evidentiary items with gloves and submit to an appropriate lab as the 
situation dictates. Traditional forensic processes (e.g., DNA, latent prints) on a mobile device should 
be completed before digital forensic processes. 
Access 
User-created passwords also complicate the recovery of mobile device data. Collect and document 
this information if possible, and subject to applicable procedural and legal requirements in your 
jurisdiction. 
  
Network Isolation 
Disconnect mobile devices from their networks to ensure data is not remotely modified or destroyed. 
Mobile devices typically have a reset capability that clears all user content, resetting device memory 
to the original factory condition. Because this may be performed in person or remotely, immediate 
precautions (e.g., separate the device from its user, network isolation) are necessary to ensure 
evidence is not modified or destroyed.

Generally, examiners isolated a mobile device from network connectivity by placing the device in 
“airplane mode”. The “airplane mode” feature in newer versions of mobile operating systems may not 
disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other wireless protocols or may only disconnect them temporarily. 
Examiners should manually confirm that network connectivity has been disabled or consider alternate 
means of isolation, including placing the device in an RF shielded enclosure, removing the SIM card 
from the device or utilizing a Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) for GSM phones. 
The responder should also restrict any interaction with the device unless in a controlled environment. 
This is to safeguard the data on the device and also ensure that the device does not automatically 
connect to cloud services or networks as this may change the data on the device or enable wiping of 
the device remotely. 
Powering off the device to isolate it from the network poses the risk of engaging authentication 
mechanisms (e.g., passwords, PINs) or enabling enhanced security features, potentially rendering data 
inaccessible. 
Points to Prove 
The responder should also consider points to prove for the investigation when submitting the device 
to the digital forensics lab as smartphones contain lots of data and not all data will be pertinent to the 
case.  
Some forensics software allow the data from the exhibits SIM card to be cloned onto a blank SIM card 
(Clone) with the original data copied onto the cloned SIM card with the network data omitted. The 
phone associates call logs, settings and other data with the SIM card. If a mobile phone is started with 
another card or without a card, this information cannot be accessed and maybe be lost.  
How to proceed: 
a) The device is on. 
- 
Photograph the screen in the state it is in. Check the battery and if the date and time the 
device shows correspond to the actual date and time upon seizure. 
- 
IMEI check: dial * # 06 # and photograph. 
- 
Make a logical image of the device with the forensic device, including reading the SIM. 
- 
Make a physical image of the device if it is supported. 
- 
Turn off the device. Remove battery, SIM / USIM card and memory expansion card and 
photograph the assembly with the identification tag. 
- 
Make a forensic image of the memory card, as described in its specific procedure, if it has not 
been performed by the forensic team. 
- 
Do not turn on the equipment again. 
- 
All elements are sealed together and marked as processed. 
 
b) The device is off. 
- 
Check if support is available for acquiring a forensic image. 
- 
The battery is removed and the items to be checked are located: SIM card and external 
memory.

- 
A SIM / USIM card is read by checking if it is protected by a PIN. If available, it is entered only 
once, because if it is tried 3 times without success, it is blocked. To unlock it, you will need the 
PUK code, which is located on the original cardholder or that can be requested from the 
mobile service provider. In any case, the ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) will be 
obtained, which is its serial number. 
- 
A blank SIM card is recorded with the original SIM card data and inserted into the terminal. 
The phone associates call logs, settings and other data with the SIM card. If a mobile phone is 
started with another card or without a card, this information cannot be accessed. The card 
generated as a copy of the original guarantees, in addition to keeping this data that the device 
will not connect to the network. 
- 
A forensic copy is made of the memory card, if any, following the procedure proposed for this 
type of storage media. 
- 
The device is recomposed, turned on and a logical image is extracted following the system 
instructions. 
- 
If it is supported, a physical image is also made. 
- 
All elements are sealed together and marked as processed. 
- 
Try to locate and create a record of original containers and SIM cardholders with visible PIN 
and PUK. 
 
5.2. Servers 
Server-type computer equipment provides service to other client computers. We can find them mainly 
in business environments performing functions of a file server, mail, web services, database, user 
management, etc. 
Physically they can look like a normal workstation or they can be mounted on rack systems. 
Before proceeding with a server some aspects have to be considered: 
What does the Court order/relevant legal authorization permit? Servers can be a fundamental part of 
the normal development of a company's activity, which does not have to be necessarily involved in 
the commission of the criminal act. Is it justified to leave an organization, possibly extraneous to the 
crime, without service? Is the equipment seizure really needed? 
Do we have the collaboration of the administrator or system management personnel? Can they be 
trusted? Are they involved in the criminal activity? 
Is it clear what kind of information has to be acquired?  
Are we familiar with server environments and their operating systems? Can we disconnect the server 
from the data network and even turn it off to isolate it from the outside? 
The preferred process to seize information from servers is to make a selective logical copy of the 
suspect's folder. But you also have to consider getting the event logs, the active directory settings, 
mailboxes and the backups. 
5.3. Personal Computers 
The first step will be to determine if the computer is turned on. Many computers can be in a power-
saving mode, with the monitor simply turned off, in a state of sleep, hibernation (Windows) giving the 
feeling that they are disconnected or powered off. We will have to check if the monitor has power and 
connection to the equipment and if the unit has power or has a LED that indicates activity.

32
 
 
To remove the computer from this state we will avoid pressing the power or reset button or the 
"Enter" key. It is best to move the mouse first or use the scroll or shift keys. Take note of the exact 
time of this action for further records. 
If the equipment is turned on and shows activity, it is advisable to take the following measures: 
● Take a picture of the screen as it appears and include date, time and time zone. 
● Check the activity the user is performing at that moment, like active icons, process bars, and 
application operation indicator. If it is observed that any destructive process is being executed, 
such as secure deletion, deletion of logs or records, etc., it must be interrupted immediately, 
even and if necessary, by pulling the power cable. 
● Check the existence of network, wireless or cable connections. 
● Disable screensavers or power setting modes. The purpose is to avoid the device to enter 
savings states or shut down, losing the original state of the system. 
● Check the mounted volumes and their characteristics, basically looking for the use of 
encryption or connection to shared folders on another computer in the network. 
● Check the possible existing activities and connections to remote repositories such as Dropbox, 
Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. and the current activity of browsers, like webmail pages, social 
networks, etc. 
At this time, the possibility of maintaining or disconnecting the network connections must be 
assessed, isolating the equipment. 
a) If the device is switched on  
Evaluation on-site (Triage). As a continuation of the preservation process and in cases where a specific 
data set is being sought or the existence of certain information must be established immediately (due 
to legal or procedural requirements), a direct examination of the equipment can be carried out in the 
presence of the interested party and the witnesses. Forensic logical copies of the data of interest can 
be performed. This procedure is common in cases of child sexual abuse in certain jurisdictions, 
however, from a technical point of view and good practices, certain nuances should be considered. 
The less invasive procedure will be used. Just as we try to preserve a device as much as possible so 
that other types of traces can be obtained (DNA, fingerprints, etc.) in the same way it is convenient 
not to compromise the original data for the subsequent analysis performed by experts if needed. 
If you have to use applications, they must be reliable and if possible, be specifically designed for this 
function and validated by the competent laboratory for the environment that is presented to us.  
Procedure of “Live data forensics” or live analysis. The purpose is to obtain the maximum information 
from the equipment before it is turned off, with minimal necessary alteration of the original, including 
those volatile elements of the equipment that are of interest to the investigation to be analyzed later, 
such as RAM. 
It is necessary in devices that contain encrypted volumes or disks, but which are mounted at the time 
of the intervention, as in the case of systems with BitLocker, FileVault, VeraCrypt, TrueCrypt, BestCrypt 
or PGP Disk or similar solutions. With this procedure, we will obtain the decrypted data without having 
to resort to the password, without prejudice to obtaining it through the analysis of other elements. 
A similar case is hardware encryption using Trusted Platform Module chips (TPM) or through keys 
stored in external devices (USB devices), in which this procedure is performed to extract the decrypted 
data or it would be necessary to have the entire original system mounted to get that information.

In case of not being able to procure an expert’s support, it is better to turn off the equipment in the 
manner mentioned in the following point to avoid destroying the original electronic content or 
contaminating it by risking its probative value. 
Power off procedure. Once the live process part is completed, we will proceed to power off the 
computer. The best way to do this will depend on the type of device and its operating system. 
Conventionally shutting down the equipment may cause us to lose information, however, on other 
occasions, it will be necessary to perform that conventional shutdown to avoid losing that information. 
Operating systems whose processing involves performing a sudden power off procedure, execute a 
series of steps to shut down properly. These process sequences imply the loss of crucial information 
for the analysis phase. 
Unconventional shutdowns that involve the removal of the power supply cable must be done by 
removing the cable from the device, and not from the wall socket since an Uninterruptible Power 
Supply System (UPS) can be located between the wall connection and the device connection. 
b) If the device is switched off 
Forensic copies or direct seizure of the equipment will be obtained. 
It makes no sense to compromise the integrity of original evidence of a computer that is shut down 
by turning it on. In case of urgency or in need of immediate location of information, the device is 
analyzed in read-only mode through a blocker so that it remains unchanged. 
Once the scene and situation of the computer have been documented and it is verified that it is turned 
off, we will remove any power supply connected to the equipment to avoid unexpected electric 
shocks. Therefore, the power supply cable will be removed from the device, never from the wall. 
Do not forget to take note of the connected elements using the sketch or device file. 
The box will be disassembled to locate the hard drives. They will be labelled according to the agreed 
system and processed using the appropriate means. 
It must be considered in the possibility of finding disks configured in RAID. In case of doubts, the 
equipment must be seized together with the hardware to facilitate its subsequent reconstruction, 
without removing the disks from the device. 
You should check if there is any disc inside the CD-DVD readers. For this, it is not necessary to turn on 
the equipment; it is sufficient to operate with a clip in the mechanical unlocking hole. 
General rules explained before will also be considered: 
● After documenting the status and situation in which the equipment is found, the entire device 
is sealed. In this way, we ensure that they contain all the elements that can store information. 
● Disassembling the equipment is not always straightforward. Do not do it on-site if you are not 
familiar and have the proper tools. 
● The availability of the original hardware in the laboratory can be very useful. For example, if 
the computer has some kind of special elements, such as a RAID disk controller, TPM 
encryption chip or any other particular element that may be necessary for the reconstruction 
of the information. It can also make it possible to perform a live boot of the equipment in the 
laboratory, for example, to study the presence and behaviour of some type of malware 
infection.

34
 
 
● In case of simple or standardized equipment, it will not be necessary to seize the complete 
equipment and it will be enough to seize the data storage media, since there will not be 
compatibility issues.  
● As a general rule, those media that do not provide research value are not seized. In principle, 
peripherals, monitors, mice, keyboards and their cables are not necessary, unless they do not 
correspond to the usual ones for connection types, to be proprietary models of a brand for 
example or, because they are already obsolete and difficult to find today. So, they can be 
useful in the analysis phases. 
● Most user-level printers do not contain useful information. However, they can have limited 
memory that can be analyzed in the laboratory in exceptional cases.  
5.4. Laptops 
The same process as for desktop will be applied with some specificities. 
When seizing a laptop, consider using its own bag, including charger, cables and accessories. Once 
closed, it will be sealed using a system that secures the entire assembly. To turn off the laptop, first 
remove the battery (if possible) and then remove the power cable. 
Current laptops, especially "notebook" types, have batteries and hard drives integrated into the 
computer so it is not always easy or possible to remove them. We can find laptops with NVMe/SSD 
type disks integrated into the mainboard, in which it will not be possible to obtain a forensic copy by 
using methods explained in the previous section. Many of these computers require the use of special 
tools, and to avoid damaging them, responders should be familiar with the disassembly procedures.  
One of the solutions is to boot the computer from a bootable media with its own forensic operating 
system, either from CD-DVD or USB. Once the operating system is booted using volatile memory, 
various utilities can be used to carry out evaluation work, triage or acquisition of evidence. 
There are numerous products both commercial and from free/open source software: 
● CAINE (https://www.caine-live.net/) 
● DEFT Linux (http://www.deftlinux.net) 
● ASR data SMART Linux (http://asrdata.com/forensic-software/smartlinux/) 
● KALI Linux (https://www.kali.org/downloads/) 
When one of these systems is used, the practitioner has to keep in mind that the original evidence 
should not be altered. Therefore, use products that you are familiar with and have been verified to 
protect the integrity of the original devices. The tools and systems mentioned above are not endorsed 
or promoted by INTERPOL; for further information in this respect, please review the disclaimer on 
page 1 of these guidelines. 
 
5.5. Storage media (memory cards, flash drives, external hard drives, optical discs, 
etc.) 
There is a huge variety of storage media based on flash memories. They are becoming smaller in 
physical size but nevertheless with a greater data storage capacity. We can find memories of these 
types camouflaged or integrated into objects of the most varied shapes, so the specialist who 
identifies these elements has to be familiar with the different presentations. 


$01010101010101€01010101010101¥01010101010101$01010101010101€0101010101

With the emergence of other data storage media, optical discs are currently falling into disuse. 
However, they are still an element to consider. We may find the discs grouped in batches or tubs of 
discs. 
The applications are endless. We can see external memories in virtually all electronic devices, from 
video game consoles, phones, cameras to video cameras, etc. But they are also capable of housing 
fully functional, complete operating systems that facilitate the anonymity of the activity carried out 
with them. 
On the other hand, it is also common to find storage systems on external hard drives, which through 
USB, Wi-Fi or Ethernet connections are capable of storing large amounts of data. 
How to proceed: 
a) Forensic image 
Although many devices have a tab for write blocking, you should not trust that it works and does it 
correctly. Therefore, we will use our forensic equipment with the appropriate blocker, either 
hardware or software. 
As for external hard drives, it is possible to extract the internal disk it contains, to perform the copying 
process directly on that element. This procedure requires the corresponding documentation process, 
both of the internal disk and of the enclosure that contains it, as previously seen. 
Once the evidence is connected to the write-blocker and the latter to the forensic station, a forensic 
image can be made. 
There are precautions to take with these devices. Sometimes it is necessary to locate evidence of the 
use of external devices on a computer. The use of the above mentioned blockers might not be able to 
record a device’s serial number that is registered in the operating systems; which may be vital to help 
us link a device with a memory. This number is collected from the memory controller chip and is not 
recorded in the HD, and therefore in the forensic image we acquire.  
b) Evaluation (Triage) 
In order to access the contents of a memory device to assess its relevance to the case, it is essential 
to use blockers as noted above, either by software - provided and validated by reference laboratories 
- or by blockers by firmware. In case of optical discs, you can proceed with your exam using a CD / DVD 
reader that does not allow writing. 
Through this prior examination, you determine whether or not they may be interesting to the 
investigation. Keep in mind that we can find a large number of these types of elements during the 
search warrant and it is not effective to copy all the material without previously evaluating it (unless 
there is any requirement to the contrary in the laws or procedures of your jurisdiction). 
In case of seizure of optical discs, the same container in which they are kept can be used, ensuring 
that it is closed and placed in a sealed bag after being identified by the evidence number. If they appear 
individually, they are placed in a plastic case that physically protects them where the identification of 
the evidence is incorporated, sealing them in an evidence collection bag. It is not advised to use 
adhesives directly on the discs. It can cause reading errors when decompensated or physically damage 
them when removing the adhesives. Permanent markers can be used to identify them. It is not 
advisable to group them with rubber bands or flanges since they damage the ends of the discs and 
can leave them unusable.

Figure 10: Digital cameras 
5.6. Other devices (Digital cameras, GPS navigation systems, Dash Cameras, etc.) 
Data sources in these devices include: 
a) External storage memory: to work with any other external storage device. 
b) Internal memory: a large part of the devices also have an integrated memory, usually of limited 
capacity, but which allows data to be stored and must be checked. 
The proposed procedure is as follows: 
- 
Once the device is located, a picture in situ is taken. 
- 
The camera is documented with its general data by assigning an evidence number. The serial 
number is important. 
- 
It is checked if it has an external storage media; if so, it is extracted and documented. 
- 
A forensic image of the card is acquired. 
- 
The camera should be turned on (without a card) and the internal memory should be checked. 
If there is content it can be extracted: 
- 
Through the connection cable of the device to the PC, making an image. Not all devices have 
that possibility. 
- 
Inserting a new card and copying the data to the latter, so that we get a logical copy. 
- 
If the other options are not possible you can take photographs of the content trying to show 
the interesting data related to the investigation. 
- 
It is checked in the camera settings: date, time and time zone. 
All elements are sealed together and marked as processed. 
If the device is not going to be processed and simply seized, proceed as follows: 
- 
Document the equipment: photography, general data and situation of the finding. If possible, 
locate discs with software and PC connection cables. 
 
Pack everything, if possible, using the original boxes, in an identified seal bag and with the number of 
evidence. 
5.7. IoT devices 
In addition to the traditional IT devices described above, in recent years several devices have been 
defined as "IoT" or the Internet of Things. These devices can be very different from each other in terms

of functionality, such as smartwatches, smart TVs, video surveillance devices, and so on. Below we will 
see some examples of the most popular devices that could be found in use by our suspect. 
 
Figure 11: Smart watches 
5.7.1. Smartwatches 
A smartwatch contains several functionalities, allowing you to do many things you normally do with 
your phone. In fact, it is a peripheral; an extension of the screen of your smartphone that you have in 
your pocket. The smartwatch could be on the suspect and they are usually discreet: they do not emit 
sounds but vibrate gently and they can be connected to an iPhone or Android, so you must be careful 
when looking for them. There are many different Smartwatches on the market; the most common 
ones are Apple Watch, Xiaomi, Sony Smartwatch, Honor and Samsung Gear. 
Depending on the case, they may contain useful information for investigators, but please keep in mind 
that these devices usually have very limited storage capacity, mostly related to contacts in the phone 
book, SMS, information on sports habits, etc. 
Usually, they are equipped with Bluetooth connection but some of them can be equipped with a USB 
port, so the investigator can usually acquire the content through the usual equipment, almost the 
same as on any Android smartphone/tablet would be. 
If you intend to seize a smartwatch, it would be preferable to follow the same indications already 
provided in the smartphone section. 
 
Figure 12: A Smart TV. 
5.7.2. Smart TV 
It is becoming popular to find Smart TVs with the capability to connect to the internet, run apps or 
play games. Some are based on Android while some others are based on proprietary operating

systems. The exact functionality provided depends on the make, model, peripherals attached or apps 
installed.  
From the perspective of a digital-first responder, extracting the information from these devices is a 
challenge as every extraction would be different depending on the factors listed before as well as the 
current version of the operating system.  
Most of the Smart TVs present vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Possible extraction opportunities 
imply a modification of firmware, browser attacks, network attacks, use of malicious apps or chip off.  
However, most of these extraction processes are not straightforward and require sophisticated 
equipment (especially for chip-off) or complex network structures that are incompatible with first 
responders’ activity. Improper processes can “brick the device” and make further attempts impossible 
to extract information.  
As a general rule the process will include the following steps: 
● Review connections to find connected USBs, HDMI or network connections.  
● Check with the manufacturer if the model has a wireless capability (if the device is not 
connected in any way it might be dismissed). 
● Verify if the system is powered off or on standby. 
● Use the user interface to explore the device configuration, create a visual record of the 
investigator’s actions, preferable with video records.  
● Try to minimize the interaction by reading the TV manual before testing. 
● Secure packing including remote and power cable.  
Possible evidence to be found during the search and seizure: 
● Connected devices (for screen mirroring, synchronization). 
● Browsing history. 
● Users of the installed applications (Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Netflix, Amazon…). However, 
passwords will not be easy to recover at this stage and might require further processes at 
the Digital Forensic Lab.

5.7.3. Home kits/Smart speakers 
Home kits allow users to communicate with and control connected accessories in their home simply 
using an app. With the Home Kit framework, you can provide a way to configure accessories and create 
actions to control them. 
HomePod is an audio device produced by Apple that adapts to its location and delivers high-fidelity 
audio wherever it is playing. Together with Apple Music and Siri, it creates a way to interact with music 
at home.

Possible evidence to be found during the search and seizure: 
● They usually contain a very limited amount of data. It is advisable to seize them only if you 
have reasons to believe they contain useful data for your case. Just disconnect them from the 
power grid and seize them the way you found them. Document everything, take pictures of 
the device, label and pack it. 
 
Figure 14: Internet Protocol Cameras send image data over an IP network 
5.7.4. IP and concealed cameras 
IP cameras or concealed cameras are typically used for small scale monitoring and, unlike CCTV, these 
devices might not have local storage capabilities. Most of the IP cameras available only need a Wi-Fi 
connection to work. The user can watch the camera live stream from any device connected to the 
Internet. It also might be possible, if the user subscribed for a cloud-stored package, to watch recorded 
footage (usually in a loop of the previous days). 
Despite that, first responders must assure that such devices do not have a memory card (usually a 
micro-SD) for local storage. 
First responders must also be aware that cameras can be concealed almost everywhere: from teddy 
bears to buttons in a jacket. 
Possible evidence to be found during the search and seizure: 
● For cloud-stored data, it is important to obtain the online access credentials (usually username 
and password or QR code). Those credentials might be stored in the camera itself or in 
computers/smartphones found with the suspect. 
● For local-stored data, usually, only the memory card needs to be seized. However, due to the 
possibility of encryption, proprietary file systems or non-documented settings, it is advisable 
to seize the whole equipment.  
● For live-only data (the camera only streams live footage - not cloud or local storage), it is 
advisable to seize it only if you have reasons to believe that it contains useful data for your 
case.  
● For video forensic analysis, comparing previous footage with the camera found, the device 
must always be seized.

When the seizure is necessary, just disconnect it, document everything, take pictures of the device, 
label and pack it. 
 
Figure 15: Nintendo, Sony's PS Series, and Microsoft's XBOX are examples of gaming consoles with smart functions. 
5.8. Gaming consoles 
The complexity of video game consoles is increasing in every new model. Most of them contain an 
internal hard drive that can be extracted and imaged following forensic procedures explained before. 
However, the heavy usage of encryption and use of special file types makes it extremely difficult to 
discern any information in a later analysis. On top of that, a good amount of the information generated 
would be stored in the gaming social platforms and never stored in the hard drive.  
Finally, it is important to consider that users from other locations might easily alter the information 
contained within these devices and remove potential evidence.  
Possible evidence to be found during the search and seizure: 
● Define periods on which the video console was used for gaming. 
● Browsing history. 
● Illicit files stored on Video console media. 
● Application passwords. 
● User Accounts.

Figure 16: Drones, also known as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) 
5.9. Drones 
Drones - also referred as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned aerial system (UAS), small 
unmanned aerial system (sUAS) or remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) - can be used for a variety 
of operations, ranging from aerial photography and videos to transporting goods from one place to 
another. Therefore, the aim of carrying out digital forensics on drones and associated equipment is to 
identify flight paths, user data, and associated pictures and videos contained within the devices that 
will assist in understanding the drone and its usage. 
A drone usually consists of the following two types of components: 
❖ 
Physical Components: The physical components which make up the body and flight 
mechanisms can be broken down into the following categories: 
 
 
Drone Body: The core fuselage of the UAV used to house all other components. 
 
Flight Controller: Used to control flight. This device will stabilize the drone and 
generally accept navigation input from a radio control device. In more sophisticated 
systems the flight controller can both be controlled remotely in real-time and be pre-
programmed for autonomous flight. 
 
Motors, Rotors/Propellers/Wings, and Speed Controllers: These component parts 
combined provide the lift and propulsion for the UAV. Different designs exist, for 
example, specializing in increased speed or flight duration. 
 
Protective Casing: This protection securely encases the motors and propellers (the 
most vulnerable component of any drone) to prevent collision and loss of control and 
subsequent damage to the system. 
 
GPS Receiver: Not essential in all drones, but common in the leading solutions. This 
component is used to effectively manage UAV position, return to home functionally, 
and autonomous flight routes. 
 
Radio Receiver: Used to receive control input signals received/gathered from the 
ground-based transmitter. 
 
Transmitter: Transmits manual input from the operator on the ground to the drone. 
 
LED Lights: Some drones come equipped with LED lights (usually green and red) which 
can be used to aid the pilot of the orientation of the drone, and help other airspace 
users to identify the drone. 
 
❖ 
Software: All drones include an application or software that is used to control the system 
when it is operational. There is now a huge selection of open-source flight control and ground 
control applications available online that can be freely downloaded and easily modified to 
perform any number of tasks. The majority of drones come with companion mobile

applications to either pilot the drone or view the camera feed and location of the drone 
overlaid on a map. 
Drones/controllers are usually presented with two distinct media storage types that require separate 
handling techniques, as in the following summary: 
● Memory Cards: These can be examined as a computer hard disk. Both logical and physical 
extraction can be conducted on these cards, as long as the forensic tools support this feature. 
The examiner has to access the card, extract the data, and then put it back into the device 
before switching it on. Some devices store data in the memory card, and if it detects that the 
card is not available, it could cause data loss from the drone/controller. If time and resources 
allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and that clone inserted into 
the handset. 
● Internal Memory: This requires drone/mobile compatible manufacturer/forensic tools. Some 
devices are supported by forensic tools for physical extraction. The forensic tools will boot the 
device in a particular way and conduct physical extraction without making any changes or 
alterations to the user data on the device. 
As a general rule the technical process will include the following steps: 
● If on, take pictures of the controller’s display then turn off the drone and its components. 
● Isolate the drone from GPS satellites and other devices to ensure that GPS/Wi-Fi/Network 
signals are not picked up. 
● Identify the make and model of the drone. 
● Search the drone for any external storage media, i.e. SD Cards. 
● Photograph and label the status of the drone and its components. 
● Securely pack all of the components. 
Possible evidence to be found during the search and seizure: 
● Update history 
● Diagnostic logs 
● Registered email accounts 
● Paired devices 
● Multimedia files 
● Flight/telematics logs 
● Drone media thumbnail caches 
● Map artefacts such as geo-coordinates, waypoints, and home locations 
● Drone specific software such as manufacturers’ drone management software 
● Emails that show new registration of drones or update notifications from the manufacturer 
● CSV files that contain telematics, diagnostics or GPS coordinates.

Figure 17: CCTV Cameras being used for surveillance purposes. 
5.10. CCTV 
Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to 
transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in 
that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point-to-point (P2P), point-to-
multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links. Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, 
the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such 
as banks, stores, and other areas where security is needed. 
CCTV security system consists of different components. These include: 
● CCTV Camera: used for video surveillance and acts as the input device to the system CCTV 
Monitor. This device receives signals and reproduces pictures or videos captured by the CCTV 
camera. 
● Main Power Supply: the primary electrical supply unit. 
● Backup Power Supply (optional): backup power supply comes in handy in case of a power 
outage 
● Cables: these are used to connect several CCTV cameras to one video recorder, video switcher 
for CCTV monitor, also modern CCTV systems may utilize Wi-Fi networks to transmit the 
pictures to a central point. 
● Video Recorder: transforms and records signals sent by a CCTV camera in the form of a video 
that is generally stored on a hard drive and may be deleted automatically depending on the 
device settings. 
● Video Switcher: switches the video mode between different CCTV cameras. 
As a general rule the technical process will include the following steps: 
● Check time and date set on the video recorder and report if they differ from the current 
ones 


1010101$10101010101010101¥01010101010101€01010101010101¥01010101010101$

● Take pictures of the screen(s) 
● Shut the recorder down to avoid data to be overwritten 
● Disconnect cables 
● Identify make and model  
● Photograph and label all the components 
● Securely pack everything. 
Usually, CCTV system components are proprietary, therefore it is advised to seize every part of the 
CCTV system, in order to avoid issues during the analysis phase.   
Remote monitoring may also be applied to CCTV systems and may also have alert systems in place to 
warn the user if the systems sense movement. This should be considered when approaching a crime 
scene as the suspect may be alerted/notified if police approach a scene that is being monitored by 
CCTV camera systems such as RING etc. Therefore, when examining the CCTV system you should also 
consider the registered users who have remote access to the CCTV system. 
 
 
Figure 18: Virtual asset devices, used for storing information about cryptocurrencies and other virtual currencies. 
 
5.11. Virtual assets devices 
First responders need to be aware of the different ways to access, store and transfer virtual assets. To 
allow the proper seizure of a cryptocurrency, and if permitted by the laws of the jurisdiction and the 
terms of the relevant judicial or other authorization, law enforcement needs to transfer the funds 
from the suspect’s wallet to an official and secured wallet controlled by the seizing agency.  
Furthermore, first responders need to bear in mind that an accomplice might have a copy of the 
information needed to transfer the funds to a wallet not controlled by the law enforcement agency. 
Thus, as soon as the cryptocurrencies are securely transferred, the better. 
Cryptocurrency wallets come in different shapes and forms: files in a computer/phone, hardware 
devices, QR codes or even a sequence of words written in a piece of paper or memorized by the 
suspect. During a police search, first responders might face: 
● Desktop wallets: Bitcoin Core, Armory, Electrum, Wasabi, Bither, etc. 
● Mobile wallets: Mycelium, Edge, BRD, Trust, etc. 
● Online wallets: BitGo, BTC.com, Coin.Space, Blockchain.com, etc. 
● Hardware wallets: BitBox, Coldcard, KeepKey, Ledger, Trezor, etc. 
● Paper wallets: addresses generated by bitaddress.org, segwitaddress.org, etc.

● Brain wallets: seed (list of words which store all the information needed to restore the wallet). 
Regardless of the wallet type, the crucial information that first responders need to access is the 
unencrypted Private Key, which will allow the transactions to be properly signed and the funds 
transferred.  
In most cases, however, the Private Key is protected, or it might not be stored locally. Thus, first 
responders should also seek for: 
● Passwords: used to encrypt the private key 
● PINs: to access hardware wallets or phones 
● Credentials: username and password for online wallets 
● QR codes: that can store the full private key 
● Seeds: the sequence of words (typically 24 or more) used to recreate the private key. 
For the most popular cryptocurrency3, Bitcoin, private keys are 256-bit numbers that can be 
represented in many different ways. Wallet Import Format (WIF) is the most common type and the 
keys start with '5', 'K' or 'L'. An encrypted private key starts with '6P'. 
For example, the same Private Key can be represented as: 
● Base58 Wallet Import Format (51 characters base58, starts with a '5'): 
5JoBSup7GzCohqzfCdU3FQmuQM8KLCu3TTKiTAtbzmWywJfzTni 
● Base58 Wallet Import Format Compressed (52 characters base58, starts with a 'K' or 'L'): 
L1Yq7N6vhZV79HFVcKxLvbwCJ3qHumWhqmBbxWemTyVLJHfaUjTc 
● Private Key BIP38 Encrypted Format (58 characters base58, starts with '6P') - password: 
'asdfg': 
6PYLTEjqt2huN6zgG8Gc2Sdifh33tcDLoJMXXqdK52YrQWXa3fD8az9Za7 
First responders must also be able to identify a Public Key (or simply Address), which is the possible 
destination of a transfer or payment. For example, Bitcoins Addresses can start with '1', '3' or 'bc1': 
● P2PKH Format: 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2 
● P2SH Format: 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy

An important consideration that must be taken into account, depending on your legal system, is what 
to do with the transferred virtual asset: exchange into fiat money as soon as possible or keep it in the 
official wallet until there is a final sentence. 
Finally, do not forget to document all the steps taken, including the transaction fees, the value of the 
bitcoin in local currency and exchanges eventually used. Also, it can be useful to add screenshots of 
the transaction (using for example www.walletexplorer.com). 
For further details, please refer to your local legislation. Guidelines, like the INTERPOL Guidelines on 
Darknet and Cryptocurrencies for Counter-Terrorism Practitioners may also be useful to refer for 
further background on virtual assets. 
 
5.12 Automotive Vehicles 
Modern vehicles have two systems that could contain data that may be pertinent to an investigation. 
There are: 
Telematics Network – This includes various Electronic Control Units (ECU) that monitor the vehicles 
state and apply user input to move the vehicle such as acceleration, braking and steering. These ECUs 
contain vehicle event data that may assist an investigation in locating historical routes the car has 
taken or in the way it is driven. 
Infotainment Systems – These systems provide multimedia entertainment such as music, radio 
broadcasts and streamed or locally stored videos to the vehicle occupants as well as allow a connected 
experience to the internet or a connected phone. If a user connects a phone to the system, then data 
from the phone such as address book, SMS/instant messages and calls will be stored within the 
infotainment system. This information may be recovered when the device connected to the system 
and to verify any event data recorded from the connected device. 
Infotainment and telematics systems present unique challenges to law enforcement due to 
differences in hardware designs and manufacturers, limited information on the underlying software 
and proprietary operating systems, encrypted media associated with Digital Rights Management 
(DRM), and rapid changes in technology. Acquisition options may be limited by hardware and software 
available to facilitate data extraction. A visual examination of an active screen/system may be required 
if other techniques are unsuccessful. Examiners should be aware that the vehicle's digital systems are 
like any other digital device/system and therefore, must be handled appropriately to prevent data 
destruction. A modern-day vehicle will contain multiple computers and/or networks and consequently 
the examiner should take reasonable measures to isolate the car from wireless networks (Wi-Fi, 
cellular, Bluetooth, etc.).  
ECUs always draw power from a vehicle's battery, even while the ignition switch is in the off position. 
Many ECUs, like the infotainment and telematics systems, utilize critical components such as an unlock 
event or doors opening/closing as cues to enter low-power mode or start the power-up procedure. 
Minimizing the number and duration of power cycles helps preserve volatile data stored on ECUs. 
Processing a vehicle for physical evidence may cause additional power cycles resulting in the loss of 
relevant volatile data from the ECUs. To mitigate this risk, document the on-screen data and properly 
shut down the vehicle to allow the ECUs to correctly power down before processing physical evidence 
(latent prints, DNA, GSR, etc.) 


1010101$10101010101010101¥01010101010101€01010101010101¥01010101010101$

The following are general guidelines for properly shutting down a vehicle to preserve evidence:  
 
Document the date and time these steps are performed. Turn off the vehicle and exit with all 
key fobs. 
 
Close all doors · Open the driver's door for 5 secs. 
 
Close the driver's door and wait approximately 2 minutes. 
 
Disconnect vehicle power (e.g. disconnect the battery or place the vehicle into transport 
mode). 
To verify that the car was completely shut down, ensure the center stack of the vehicle, as well as the 
instrument cluster and interior/exterior lights, have been off for 30-45 seconds after all doors were 
closed. Wait 60 seconds. 
Evidence Handling 
Review legal authority before handling and collecting evidence, ensuring any restrictions are noted. If 
necessary, during the collection phase, obtain additional authorization for evidence outside the 
original scope. Infotainment and telematics systems may consist of separate ECUs located in different 
locations within a vehicle or maybe a single integrated ECU that has dual functionality. General 
guidelines for working with vehicles associated with an investigation include: 
 
Handle evidence according to agency policy and maintain a chain of custody. 
 
Preserve the state of the ECUs before the physical processing of a vehicle. 
 
If physical forensic processing of a car (DNA, latent prints, etc.) is required, discuss these 
requirements and the order in which they should be performed with the investigator and 
crime lab personnel to avoid inadvertent destruction of physical and digital forensic evidence. 
 
Biological contaminants and physical destruction provide unique challenges to the recovery 
of data. Use universal precautions to protect the health and safety of the examiner. 
 
Infotainment and/or telematics systems may have active external connections (e.g. cellular, 
Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth). Isolate the vehicle from connecting to external networks when possible; 
e.g., disconnect antennas or cellular modems, remove SIM cards, etc. 
Data that can be obtained from a vehicle may include the following: 
 
Vehicle System Information: Serial Number, Part Number, VIN Number, Build Number. 
 
Installed Application Data: Weather, Traffic, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. 
 
Connected Devices: Phones, Media Players USB devices, SD Cards, Wireless access points. 
 
Navigation Data: Tracklogs and track points, saved locations, previous destinations, active and 
inactive routes. 
 
Device Information: Device IDs, calls, contacts, SMS, Audio, Video, Images. 
 
Vehicle Events: Doors opening and closing, lights on/off, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/USB connections, 
GPS time syncs. Odometer readings and telematics information such as speed, brake and 
angle of steering data. 
Every car is different, and the ECUs may record various events and store different data depending on 
the configuration of the vehicle when assembled in the factory. The examiner or first responder should 
verify the vehicle's configuration by obtaining a build sheet which is referenced by the Vehicle 
Identification Number (VIN) before starting any practical forensics on the vehicle. In addition, if the 
examiner can obtain an IMEI from an ECU, they may be able to carry out investigations with the mobile

they try to capture associated evidence such as CCTV, automatic number plate recognition logs etc. 
from places that the car has been in to ensure that the evidence corroborated. 4 
 
5.13 Shipborne Equipment 
 
All vessels are different, even between sister-ships, as vessel equipment is generally dependent on the 
intended activity of the vessel, and more technically, its classification by the registration flag. Further, 
the vessel operator or Captain might also change the capabilities of the vessel once received, in line 
with what they think is the best and most efficient way to operate the vessel. For a more detailed 
information in this area, please refer to “INTERPOL Guidelines for First Responders - Digital Forensics 
on Shipborne Equipment” developed in cooperation with the Global Fisheries Enforcement (Organized 
and Emerging Crime directorate). 
The level and type of shipborne equipment fitted on each vessel is therefore linked to this classification 
and/or operator perspectives. Investigators and first responders can therefore expect very different 
levels of equipment from one vessel to another. In fact, the level of equipment on board a vessel can 
range from a basic configuration of a magnetic compass and a Very High Frequency VHF radio (VHF), 
to a high-tech configuration of cutting-edge technological equipment - including satellite 
communication technologies. In some cases, the bridges of the latter vessels share more resemblance 
with the cockpit of an airplane rather than to a vessel’s wheelhouse. 
Due to the high diversity of Shipborne Equipment, first responders should have knowledge of the 
vessel’s onboard equipment including brands, series, models and serial numbers. This is crucial and 
will give them the ability to expect what kind of evidence they might find in the ship and equipped 
with all needed tools (cables, sockets, plugs, etc.). Moreover, learning about ship equipment will save 
time by giving hints about the location of each device and which one is useful for the investigation. In 
the following figure, examples of Shipborne Equipment that include data with their locations.

1 Preface 
 
There is a critical need in the law enforcement community to ensure the reliability of 
computer forensic tools.  A capability is required to ensure that forensic software tools 
consistently produce accurate and objective results.  The goal of the Computer Forensic 
Tool Testing (CFTT) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) is to establish a methodology for testing computer forensic software tools by 
development of general tool specifications, test procedures, test criteria, test sets, and test 
hardware.  The results provide the information necessary for toolmakers to improve tools, 
for users to make informed choices about acquiring and using computer forensics tools, 
and for interested parties to understand the tools capabilities.  Our approach for testing 
computer forensic tools is based on well-recognized international methodologies for 
conformance testing and quality testing.  This project is further described at 
http://www.cftt.nist.gov/.

The CFTT is a joint project of the National Institute of Justice, the research and 
development organization of the U.S. Department of Justice; the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology Office of Law Enforcement Standards and Information 
Technology Laboratory, and other agencies, such as the Technical Support Working 
Group and the IRS.  The entire computer forensics community participates in the 
development of the specifications and test methods by commenting on drafts as they are 
published on the CFTT website. 
 
2 Introduction 
 
Frequently during a forensic examination, data is discovered on the target media that is 
not part of any active or visible file.  Although this data can still be examined (e.g. string 
searching), as would be done for unallocated space, if the data associated with a 
particular file could be identified and recovered in its original form, this could provide 
additional useful information.  An example of this would be where a graphics file, if 
undeleted and recovered, could be viewed—potentially providing more information than 
a simple string search.  Many of the forensic tools used by investigators identify files that 
have been deleted, and allow the operator to undelete them.  This may allow the 
investigator to examine the file in the original format (e.g. a graphics file viewer), or 
identify when a particular file was deleted and its original location.   
 
To reconstruct files that have been deleted within a forensic setting, three fundamental 
problems have to be addressed by a deleted file recovery (DFR) tool.  First, the files that 
have been deleted have to be identified and located.  Although this could be as simple as 
scanning directory entries for a particular key (e.g. ‘0xE5’ in Fat 32) it may be a more 
complex process.  This process is paramount for any recovery tool to work correctly, for 
if files are not correctly identified and located, they will not be part of the recovery 
process.

The second problem, from a file system perspective, is that the data to be recovered is 
latent, and needs the assistance of a tool to recover the data in a form that is usable by the 
investigator.  As with most other latent data recovery, since the results depend on the 
output of a particular tool, it must be shown to operate correctly (i.e. undelete files 
correctly). 
 
The third and final fundamental problem that needs to be addressed by deleted file 
recovery tools is the potential uncertainty in any recovery effort.  A common problem 
with all residual data recovery is that since residual data is no longer maintained by the 
file system, there is a reduced level of confidence in the information recovered.  
Specifically with deleted file recovery, the data recovered may be commingled with data 
from other deleted files, allocated files, or even from non allocated space.

This document defines the functional requirements and specifications for deleted file 
recovery tools used within forensics investigations.   
 
These requirements were developed through a combination of processes including but not 
limited to deleted file recovery research, personal interviews with forensic investigators, 
and working with a focus group of individuals who are experts in the field of forensic 
investigation and depend on the results of deleted file recovery tools.  Additionally, as 
this document evolves, feedback will be incorporated from a variety of sources, and will 
be posted to our web site at http://www.cftt.nist.gov for comments.

The scope of this specification and requirements document is limited to software that 
identifies and recovers deleted files.  The tools examined will be limited to those that are 
currently used within the general computer forensic community, as indicated from 
research and feedback from various focus groups.  The proper or improper use of a tool is 
not within the scope of this specification. 
 
The specifications and requirements for deleted file recovery are high-level, and are 
based on the following assumptions.   
 
General: 
• The deleted file recovery tools are used in a forensically sound environment.   
• The individuals using these tools adhere to forensic principles, and have control 
over the environment in which the tools are used.   
 
Tool Functions:     
• Only deleted file recovery tools and functions are examined.   
• Other types of latent data recovery are not part of this specification.   
 
Tool Environment: 
• Only the file systems supported by a given tool are tested.   
• Each file system tested is correctly configured, and is accessible if mounted on the 
appropriate and receptive operating system. 
• Only commonly used file systems will be part of the testing parameters.  
Encrypted, compressed, and distributed file systems are outside the scope of this 
document.     
 
Deleted File State: 
• It is assumed that the files used to test the deleted file recovery process were 
created and deleted in a process similar to how an end-user would create and 
delete files.   
• Files that were specifically corrupted, modified, or otherwise manipulated to 
appear deleted are outside of the scope of this document.

This section provides the technical background needed to discuss deleted file recovery 
tools and functions.  The first section outlines a brief high-level model of a file system.  
Section two covers the two most common properties of file systems, which are the basis 
for most deleted file recovery efforts.  Section three outlines some of the reference 
material used to understand file systems, and how various implementations may affect 
deleted file recovery. 
 
5.1 Abstract Model of a File System 
A file system is used to store data for access by a computer.  The data is normally stored 
within a tree-like structured hierarchy of directories and files.  File system metadata 
contains information to describe and locate every file within a given file system.  Some 
metadata resides in directory entries, but additional metadata may reside in special files 
(e.g. NTFS $MFT) or other locations (e.g. UNIX i-nodes).   
 
When a file or directory is deleted, normally the associated metadata entry is flagged as 
being no longer active.  However, in most file systems, neither the metadata associated 
with the file nor the actual content is completely removed.  This creates a situation where 
there is residual metadata (metadata remaining after a delete has occurred) that may still 
be accessible.  However, depending on the original format and structure of the metadata, 
not all of it may be reachable.  This would be the case for a fragmented directory, where 
the first data block of directory entries would be reachable even after deletion, but the 
remaining data blocks of directory entries are not.      
 
5.2 File System Properties 
File systems are designed to allow an operating system to have access to secondary 
storage in a manner that is both efficient and timely, as in the past, storage devices have 
been expensive, and slow (when compared to Random Access Memory).  Accessing the 
hard drive efficiently, although implemented differently in each file system, tends to have 
some side effects that can be exploited to recover deleted files.  Two of the most key 
properties are contiguous writes, and the conservative nature of file system activity.   
 
File systems use contiguous writes if possible:  Most operating systems write data to the 
drive in a contiguous set of data blocks or sectors if available.  A given data file, provided 
it is not modified after being written to the disk, tends to have all the data in sequentially 
accessible sectors.  This speeds up both the write and read processes, since the heads on 
the drive do not need to move to different areas on the disk to write or read data.  This 
plays a role in data recovery, in that data from a given file, even deleted, has a high 
likelihood of being grouped together on the disk in contiguous data blocks.   
 
File systems are conservative:  This characteristic implies that, in order to be as fast and 
efficient as possible, file systems perform many activities with a minimum of changes or 
overhead.  In the case of file deletion, in most situations, only a logical deletion is

performed—meaning that the actual data is not erased, but the metadata that indexes the 
information is changed, flagged or removed.  By using this technique, a file’s content, no 
matter how large, can be “deleted” by simply modifying or removing entries in a disk 
index.  The simplest example of this is how a windows FAT 32 file system deletes files.  
It locates the directory entry of the file to be deleted, and changes the beginning character 
in the file name to a ‘0xE5’ hex value, and then zeros the file allocation table.  This 
indicates to the file system that a file has been deleted, and is no longer accessible (or 
maintained) by the file system—yet most of the metadata and the entire file content 
remain.   
 
For the most part, these common attributes assist in the recovery of data on the drive, 
regardless of the type of file system the data resides on.  Many tools leverage the residual 
metadata in locating the potential file system objects, and then recover the largest amount 
of contiguous data.

Included here are definitions of terms used in this specification document.  Although 
there may be commonly accepted definitions for some of the terms, the context in which 
they are applied may change their meaning.   
 
Data Block:  File system specific data allocation unit (block), usually 512 bytes or a 
multiple of it.  Some file systems may use other terms to describe a data block 
such as Sector (in FAT file systems). 
 
Deleted Block Pool (DBP):  A conceptual collection of data blocks that were originally 
part of an FS-Object, subsequently deleted, and have not been reallocated or 
reused.   
 
Documentation:  The collection of materials available to the operator of a given 
undeletion tool or function that describes its usage, purpose, operation, or system 
requirements.   
 
Estimated Content:  A tool Estimates Content if it attempts to recover the content of a 
deleted file, beyond what is explicitly identified in the residual metadata.   
 
File System Object (FS-Object):  The fundament objects to store and organize 
information within a file system.  The most common examples of FS-Objects 
would be Files and Directories.    
 
Logical Order:  The content of a FS-Object as it would be sequentially accessed. 
 
Logical Deletion:  When an FS-Object is deleted through metadata manipulation, 
without the actual object data being erased.  For example, in FAT32, when an 
object is deleted, the directory entry is flagged, and the file allocation entries are 
cleared—the actual file data is not removed or erased.   
 
Metadata:  The associated periphery information or attributes that describe a FS-Object 
such as name, time-based metadata (creation, modification, and last accessed 
times), access rights, ownership, and location.   
 
Recovered Object (RO):  The object constructed by a Deleted File Recovery Tool 
through examining residual metadata.  Due to the potential for corruption inherent 
with data that is no longer maintained by a file system, the RO and associated 
attributes may not completely match the original FS-Object.  However, the RO is 
a sequence of data blocks with the following properties: 
 
1.  Each RO shall contain all data blocks identified from the residual metadata. 
 
2.  Each RO shall consist of only data blocks from the Deleted Block Pool.   
 
Residual Metadata:  The metadata that remains after a FS-Object has been deleted.  In 
some cases there may exist more residual metadata than can be accessed.  For example, if

The requirements section is divided into two parts.  The first, Requirements for 
Mandatory Features, are those features that are critical to the operation of the given tool, 
and must be present.  The second part is the Requirements for Optional Features.  These 
features, on the condition they are present, will be used to report on the tool capabilities.  
If a feature is not present, then requirements for those features will not be tested.   
7.1 Requirements for Mandatory Features 
All deleted file recovery tools must support the following requirements. 
 
DFR-RM-01 The tool shall support recovery efforts on file systems identified by the 
Documentation. 
 
DFR-RM-02 The tool shall identify all deleted File System-Object entries in residual 
metadata. 
 
DFR-RM-03 The tool shall report errors in constructing a Recovered Object.   
 
DFR-RM-04 The tool shall construct a Recovered Object for each deleted File System-
Object entry in residual metadata. 
 
DFR-RM-05 Each Recovered Object shall include all non-allocated data blocks 
identified in a residual metadata entry.   
 
DFR-RM-06 Each Recovered Object shall consist only of data blocks from the Deleted 
Block Pool.

7.2 Requirements for Optional Features 
The following define conditional requirements for optional features. The requirements 
below are used to report on the tool capabilities.  If the tool does not provide the 
capability defined, then the requirement will not apply.   
 
If the residual metadata for deleted files in a given file system does not identify all file 
allocation units in the deleted file, the DRF tool may optionally create a recovered object 
that estimates the likely content of an original file identified in the residual metadata by 
extrapolation from drive content. This is referred to as Estimates Content.  
 
DFR-RO-01: The tool shall report Recovered Object attributes that are recoverable from 
residual metadata. 
 
DFR-RO-02: If the tool Estimates Content then each recovered data block shall be 
assigned to a Recovered Object no more than once. 
 
DFR-RO-03: If the tool Estimates Content then the Recovered Object shall consist only 
of data blocks from the original File System-Object identified in the residual 
metadata. 
 
DFR-RO-04: If the tool Estimates Content then any data blocks in the Recovered Object 
shall be in the same logical order as in the original File System-Object identified in 
the residual metadata. 
 
DFR-RO-05: If the tool Estimates Content then the Recovered Object shall consist of 
the some number of blocks as the original File System-Object.

Introduction 
The Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) program is a joint project of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special
Program Office (SPO) and Information Technology Laboratory (ITL). CFTT is supported by other 
organizations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Defense
Cyber Crime Center, U.S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division Electronic
Crimes Program, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security’s Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
and U.S. Secret Service. The objective of the CFTT program is to provide measurable assurance 
to practitioners, researchers, and other applicable users that the tools used in computer forensics 
investigations provide accurate results. Accomplishing this requires the development of
specifications and test methods for computer forensic tools and subsequent testing of specific tools 
against those specifications. 
Test results provide the information necessary for developers to improve tools, users to make
informed choices, and the legal community and others to understand the tools’ capabilities. The 
CFTT approach to testing computer forensics tools is based on well recognized methodologies for 
conformance and quality testing. Interested parties in the computer forensics community can
review and comment 
 
on the specifications 
 
 and test methods posted on the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CFTT Website. 
This document reports the results from testing FTK 7.0.0.163 against a registry dataset that 
consists 
 
of various 
 
Windows 
 
 
NT 
 
registr
 
y hive 
 
files. 
 
The  dataset is  available 
 
at the 
 
CFReDS
 
 
website.
Test results from other tools can be found on the DHS S&T-sponsored digital forensics web page.
How to Read This Report 
This report 
 
is divided into four sections. 
 
Section 1 identifies and provides a summary of

environment 
 
and test  data (a registry 
  
 dataset) 
 
 prepared 
 
for  measurin
 
g the  success 
 
of each 
  
test. 
Section 2.3 identifies the test cases that were selected. The test 
 
cases are selected, in general, 
based on features of
 fered by the tool. Section 3 provides an overview 
 
of the test  case 
 
results 
reported by the tool.

2. Test Environment and Selected Cases 
This section describes the test execution environment, test dataset and test cases. 
2.1. Execution Environment 
FTK 7.0.0.163 was installed on Windows 7 Enterprise v6.1.7601 (x64, English). 
2.2. Test Dataset 
The tool was measured by analyzing interpreted and extracted data from various registry hive files 
developed as a reference dataset. Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 list data codes that are linked to 
registry files for testing core features and an optional feature relating to recovering deleted registry 
objects. In addition, well-known registry hive files from reference Windows systems with ground 
truth data were used to test an optional feature on extracting Windows registry forensic artifacts. 
In that regard, Table 4 defines several artifact groups considered for populating the reference 
Windows systems (Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 10RS1) to limit the scope of tool testing. 
For this tool testing, registry hive files from the last volume shadow copy (VSC) of each Windows 
system were processed by the tool, since the last VSC includes the greatest number of artifacts 
before performing anti-forensic activities to remove usage history. For more information, the 
dataset and related documents can be obtained from: www.cfreds.nist.gov.

2.3. Test Case Selection 
FTK 7.0.0.163 as an integrated multi-functional forensic toolkit does support built-in features to 
process the Windows registry hive format. The tool provides a registry hive file handler through 
an independent tool known as ‘Registry Viewer’. In addition, the ‘Evidence Processing’ feature of 
the tool also provides several options for extracting various forensic artifacts from well-known 
registry hive files. Therefore, the selected test cases are: 
• 
Core features 
◦ Processing normal registry hive files 
◦ Processing corrupted registry hive files 
◦ Processing manipulated registry hive files 

Optional features 
◦ Extracting Windows registry forensic artifacts 
The following tables give a brief description of available test cases in the dataset. Not all test cases 
are used for this tool testing.

3. Test Results 
This section provides the test results reported by FTK 7.0.0.163 and Registry Viewer 
2.0.0.7. The results are as follows: 
AS Expected 
The Windows registry forensic tool returned expected test results – the tool 
processed and reported data from registry hive files successfully. 
Partial 
The Windows registry forensic tool returned some of data from registry 
hive files. 
Observed 
The Windows registry forensic tool returned some of data from ‘corrupted’ 
or ‘manipulated’ registry hive files without any error or crash. This type of 
test results is not subject to selection between ‘As Expected’ and ‘Partial’. 
Instead, each result describes detailed behaviors when processing abnormal 
(or experimental) hive files. 
Note: The observed results may be useful to understand and improve each 
tool’s registry processing algorithms, which include format validation, 
data interpretation, anomaly detection and exception handling. 
Not As Expected The Windows registry forensic tool failed to return expected test results – 
the tool did not process or report supported data from registry hive files 
properly. 
Not Applicable 
The Windows registry forensic tool does not provide support for a 
(NA) 
particular test case.

CR-01 
Observed 
The tool didn’t return any result with the following message: 
“ERROR: Could not open file: ...” 
CR-02 
Observed 
The tool processed (probably ignored) corrupted registry objects 
without error, and it reported recoverable (accessible) keys and values. 
However, there were no notifications about abnormal data. 
CR-03 
Observed 
When processing a v1.3 hive file, the tool didn’t return any result. 
On the other hand, when processing a v1.5 hive file, the tool processed 
(probably ignored) corrupted registry objects without error, and it 
reported recoverable (accessible) keys and values. However, there 
were no notifications about abnormal data. 
CR-04 
Observed 
The tool processed (probably ignored) corrupted registry objects 
without error, and it reported recoverable (accessible) keys and values. 
However, there were no notifications about abnormal data. 
CR-05 
NA 
The tool does not support this kind of corruption. 
MR-01-1 
Observed 
The tool identified a key (the 1st subkey of the original root key) due 
to the edited ‘root cell offset’ in a base block. Although many 
allocated cells still exist, the tool didn’t identify them. 
In addition, the tool does not validate a checksum value in the base 
block. 
MR-01-2 
Observed 
The tool identified a key (the 1st subkey of the original root key) due 
to the edited ‘root cell offset’ in a base block. Although many 
allocated cells still exist, the tool didn’t identify them. 
MR-02-1 
Observed 
The tool identified a partial key name due to the edited ‘key name 
size’ in a key (nk) cell. 
MR-02-2 
Observed 
The tool did not identify a key (0x01_TYPE1_DATA-TYPES) due to the 
edited ‘key cell size’ in a key (nk) cell. That is, the tool considers ‘cell 
size’ as a key factor for parsing.

Test result 
Note 
MR-03-1 
Observed 
The tool did not identify keys (0 of 7) due to the adjusted ‘number of 
subkeys’ in a key (nk) cell. That is, the tool considers ‘number of 
subkeys’ in the key cell as a key factor for parsing. 
MR-03-2 
Observed 
The tool did not identify keys (0 of 7) due to the edited ‘subkey-list 
cell size’ in a subkey-list cell. That is, the tool considers ‘cell size’ as a 
key factor for parsing. 
MR-03-3 
Observed 
The tool did not identify keys (0 of 7) due to the adjusted ‘number of 
subkeys’ in a subkey-list cell. That is, the tool considers ‘number of 
subkeys’ in the subkey-list cell as a key factor for parsing. 
MR-03-4 
Observed 
The tool identified partial keys (3 of 7) due to zeroized ‘subkey offset’ 
items in a subkey-list cell. 
MR-04-1 
Observed 
The tool identified partial values (8 of 12) due to the adjusted ‘number 
of values’ in a key (nk) cell. 
MR-04-2 
Observed 
The tool did not identify values (0 of 12) due to the edited ‘value-list 
cell size’ in a value-list cell. That is, the tool considers ‘cell size’ as a 
key factor for parsing. 
MR-04-3 
Observed 
The tool identified partial values (8 of 12) due to zeroized ‘value 
offset’ items in a value-list cell. 
MR-05-1 
Observed 
The tool identified a partial value name (VALUE 0x0) due to the edited 
‘value name size’ (a half of the original size) in a value (vk) cell. 
MR-05-2 
Observed 
The tool did not identify a value (VALUE 0x00 (NONE)) due to the 
edited ‘value cell size’ in a value (vk) cell. That is, the tool considers 
‘cell size’ as a key factor for parsing. In addition, the tool failed to 
report types and data of other valid values. 
MR-06-1 
Observed 
The tool didn’t identify a data stream due to the NULL ‘data size’ in a 
value (vk) cell. 
MR-06-2 
Observed 
The tool did not identify a value (VALUE 0x03 (BINARY)) due to the 
edited ‘data cell size’ in a data cell. That is, the tool considers ‘cell 
size’ as a key factor for parsing. 
In addition, the tool failed to report types and data of other valid values.

Test case 
Test result 
Note 
MR-06-3 
Observed 
The tool identified a wrong data stream due to the NULL ‘data offset’ 
in a value (vk) cell. Having the NULL offset is abnormal, but there 
was no notification from the tool. 
MR-06-4 
Observed 
The tool identified a BINARY value as a string (SZ) due to the edited 
‘data type’ in a value (vk) cell. 
MR-07 
Observed 
The tool didn’t identify a big-data stream due to the NULL ‘data size’ 
in a value (vk) cell. 
In addition, the tool failed to report types and data of other valid 
values in a v1.5 hive file. 
MR-08 
Observed 
The tool processed a key loop without error. That is, it allowed users 
to access keys within a closed loop until the tool was terminated. 
In addition, the tool was terminated without any notification when 
generating a report on hive files having a key loop. 
Infinite loops are abnormal, but there was no notification from the 
tool. 
MR-09 
Observed 
The tool did not identify an integer value (VALUE 0x04 (DWORD-LE)) 
due to the invalid ‘data size’ in a value (vk) cell. The ‘data size’ item 
beyond a cell’s boundary is abnormal, but there was no notification 
from the tool. 
In addition, the tool failed to report types and data of other valid 
values. 
MR-10 
Observed 
The tool did not identify a binary value (VALUE 0x03 (BINARY)) 
due to the invalid ‘data size’ in a value (vk) cell. The ‘data size’ 
item beyond a cell’s boundary is abnormal, but there was no 
notification from the tool. 
In addition, the tool failed to report types and data of other valid 
values. 
MR-11 
Observed 
The tool did not identify a string value (VALUE 0x01 (SZ)) due to the 
invalid ‘data size’ in a value (vk) cell. The ‘data size’ item beyond a 
cell’s boundary is abnormal, but there was no notification from the 
tool. 
In addition, the tool failed to report types and data of other valid 
values. 
MR-12 
Observed 
The tool didn’t return any results. That is, the tool considers the 
version indicator in the base block as a key factor for parsing. 
MR-13 
Observed 
The tool returned printable ASCII values due to the edited ‘encoding 
flag’ in a key (nk) cell. 
MR-14 
Observed 
The tool returned printable ASCII values due to the edited ‘encoding 
flag’ in a value (vk) cell. 
MR-15 
Observed 
The tool tried to decode key/value names and data as UTF-16LE, so 
names encoded by other encoding standards could not be identified 
properly.

3.3. Results on Extracting Windows Forensic Artifacts 
The reference registry hive files were processed with FTK 7.0.0.1633 and Registry Viewer 2.0.0.7. 
DETAILS: 
This optional feature was not measured strictly by a detailed criterion. In the light of 
the fact that forensic tools may produce different forms of results although they process 
identical data to extract Windows registry forensic artifacts, this test was performed 
through comparative analysis with ground truth data and registry-related knowledge by 
CFTT staff. 
To perform test on FTK 7.0.0.163, six cases for each Windows system (Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 
10, 10RS1) were created for processing reference hive files. For each case, a disk image 
(containing hive files of the last VSC) was added as ‘Evidence’ of the tool, and then it 
was processed along with the following ‘Evidence Processing’ options. 

‘Registry Reports’ option 
◦ This option creates Registry Summary Reports4 (RSR). 
◦ RSR requires that the ‘File Signature Analysis’ option also be enabled. 

‘Generate System Information’ option 
◦ This option extracts well-known system information (including registry 
artifacts) and populates the ‘System Information Tab’. 
◦ The system information extracted by the tool includes but not limited to 
Applications (Prefetch, UserAssist, Installed), Browsers (Downloads, 
URLs), Network Information (Network Connections, Wireless Profiles), 
Owner Information, Recent Files, SAM Users and USB Devices. 

The following figure shows the ‘Evidence Processing’ profile used for this test: 
3 The ‘Time Zone’ option for each case was configured as ‘Eastern Time with Daylight Saving’. 
4 The Registry Viewer supports Registry Summary Report (RSR) generation as a part of case processing. It should be 
noted that this test only utilized the default RSR templates provided by the tool.

In addition, this tool testing also considered built-in data parsers of an independent tool, 
Registry Viewer 2.0.0.7. The built-in parsers of the tool provide information presented 
in an easy to read format on well-known data structures such as UserAssist, ShellBag 
and RecentDocs. 

Note that the Registry Viewer provides a special feature called ‘Common Areas’ 
view for quickly accessing forensically interesting registry keys. However, this 
work didn’t consider the feature because it simply provided shortcuts to pre­
defined known registry key paths without any data processing or normalization. 
As a result, the registry-related results processed by both FTK and Registry Viewer 
were identified through the following three different ways. 

System Information Tab of FTK 
◦ The System Information Tab was populated by the ‘Generate System 
Information’ option. 

Registry Summary Reports (RSRs) 
◦ HTML reports were created by the ‘Registry Reports’ option, and they 
could be accessed at ‘[Case-Directory]\registry_viewer\AutoRSR\’. 

Built-in Parsers in Registry Viewer 
◦ The ‘Key Properties’ and ‘Value Properties’ viewers of Registry Viewer 
provide parsed information for well-known data structures.

All test cases were successful except for the following. It should be noted that the remainder of 
this report mentions three different ways for identifying outputs as follows: ‘System Information 
Tab of FTK’ as FTK, ‘Registry Summary Report’ as RSR and ‘Built-in Parser in Registry Viewer’ 
as RV. In addition, unless otherwise noted, RSR reports mentioned here are composed of multiple 
tables containing keys and values without any data normalization. 
• 
Account 
◦ Partial account related data was reported. [Windows: 10RS1] 
-
The FTK reported user names only. It did not identify NT Hash values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
◦ Note that the FTK reported user names and NT Hash values only. That is, it did not 
support extracting several well-known account related fields such as ‘Logon Count’, 
‘Last Logon Time’, ‘Last Password Change Time’, ‘Invalid Logon Count’ and ‘Last 
Failed Login Time’. On the other hand, in the RSR and RV, account related data 
including those well-known fields was reported properly. [Windows: ALL9] 

Application 
◦ Partial application related data was reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
- In the FTK and RSR, 32-bit (x86) application related data in 64-bit Windows 
systems was not reported. That is, they ignored Wow6432Node key on 64-bit 
Windows systems. 
◦ All three ways (FTK, RSR and RV) did not support to extract Windows Store app10 
related data. 

Auto Run 
◦ Partial auto run related data was reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
- In the RSR, 32-bit (x86) application related data in 64-bit Windows systems was 
not reported. That is, the tool ignored Wow6432Node key on 64-bit Windows 
systems. 
9 ‘Windows: ALL’ includes Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 10RS1. (refer to Section 2.2) 
10 Artifacts on installed app packages can be identified from ‘StateRepository-Machine.srd’ SQLite file (in Windows 
10) and ‘PackageRepository.edb’ ESE file (until Windows 8.1), as well as USRCLASS hives as shown in Table4.


Dialog Usage 
◦ Dialog usage related data was not reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
-
The RSR did not identify dialog usage history from well-known keys, such as 
LastVisitedPidMRU and OpenSavePidMRU as listed in Table 4. 

External Device 
◦ All USB storage devices were reported as expected, but the following findings need 
to be taken into consideration. [Windows: ALL] 
-
The FTK identified USB storage devices and associated timestamps from Enum, 
and DeviceClasses keys of the SYSTEM hive. That is, the tool did not identify 
those data from other well-known keys, such as DeviceContainers, EMDMgmt 
and Windows Portable Devices as listed in Table 4. 
-
Since Windows 8, it has been known that there exist additional timestamps such 
as ‘First Attached Time’, ‘Last Attached Time’ and ‘Last Detached Time’. 
However, all three ways (FTK, RSR and RV) did not support reporting those 
additional data. [Windows: 8, 8.1, 10, 10RS1] 

Network Drive 
◦ Network drive related data was not reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
-
The FTK and RSR did not report network drive history. 
◦ Network drive related data was reported as expected, but the following findings need 
to be taken into consideration. [Windows: Vista, 7, 8, 8.1] 
-
The FTK and RSR identified network drives and associated timestamps from
Map Network Drive MRU and MountPoints2 keys of the NTUSER hive.
That is, the tool did not identify those data from another well-known key,
Network as listed in Table 4. 
 
 
 

OS Information 
◦ OS Information related data was reported as expected, but the following findings need 
to be taken into consideration. [Windows: ALL] 
-
The FTK simply reported raw integer data of the ‘InstallDate’ value, instead of 
converting it into a human-readable string. 
-
Note that the RSR and RV correctly identified ‘InstallDate’ value as a human-
readable string. 

Recently Opened File and Directory 
◦ Partial opened file and directory related data was reported. [Windows: Vista, 7, 8, 8.1] 
-
The FTK identified recent file history on famous user applications such as Adobe 
Reader and MS Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word). That is, the tool did not report 
those data from another well-known key, RecentDocs as listed in Table 4. 
◦ Opened file and directory related data was not reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
-
The FTK and RSR did not report opened file and directory related data. 

Run Command 
◦ Run command related data was not reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
-
The RSR failed to generate an RSR report related to run command history.

Directory paths
were reported
inaccurately.
Sample ShellBag entries identified by the FTK [Windows 7]:
◦The tool reported wrong paths including specific characters ‘{0}’.
 
The following shows manual verification results:
◦Each value of ‘BagMRU’ key contains a Known Folder ID12:
F02C1A0D-BE21-4350-88B0-7367FC96EF3C means ‘Network’ 
◦Each value of sub-keys contains a string name:
‘10.11.11.127’ 
‘\\10.11.11.127\network_dir’
‘ND+Samples’ 
◦As a result, a full path can be constructed as the following:
[Network]\10.11.11.127\\\10.11.11.127\network_dir\ND+Samples\
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ShellBag
◦
Partial ShellBag related data was reported. [Windows: ALL]
-
The FTK reported ShellBag related data in USRCLASS hives, but those data in
NTUSER hives were not reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1]
-
The FTK did not report MRU timestamps11. That is, the tool only reported MAC
(Modified/Accessed/Created) timestamps stored within each ShellBag entry.
-
The FTK incorrectly reported directory paths relating to network drives.
11 The MRU (Most Recently Used) timestamp can be identified from each key cell. Analyzing MRU timestamps of 
ShellBag entries is one of important parts to understand users’ behaviors relating to handling files and folders. 
12 In modern Windows systems, standard folders are referenced by a set of GUID (globally unique identifier) values 
called Known Folder IDs. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/shell/known-folders)

◦ UserAssist related data was not reported. [Windows: 10, 10RS1] 
-
The FTK did not report UserAssist entries. 
◦ Partial UserAssist related data was reported. [Windows: 7, 8, 8.1] 
-
The FTK only reported values having a ‘run count’ greater than 1. That is, the 
tool ignored other UserAssist values, which do not store ‘run count’ information 
as shown in the below example.

The FTK 
◦ The FTK only identified 15 values from the following path:
NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ 
UserAssist\{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count\ 
The following shows manual verification results: 
◦ As shown in the above figure, there exist other values that do not 
have ‘run count’ information, but the FTK ignored them.

◦ Note that since Windows 7 most UserAssist entries relating to user applications do 
not store ‘run count’ and ‘last run date/time’ information. Instead, it has been known 
that there exists additional information such as ‘focus count’ and ‘focus time’. 
However, both the FTK and RV did not support reporting those additional data. 
NOTES: 
The following test cases were not supported by the tool: 

Application (Windows Store app related data) 

Application Compatibility (Amcache) 

Application Compatibility (Shimcache) 

Network Connection 
◦ It should be noted that the FTK properly reported network profiles 
related data, including network name, gateway MAC address, first/last 
connect time and profile name. However, regarding this test case, the 
tool did not support extracting network interface card related data, such 
as assigned IP, Gateway and DNS addresses.

Iter di approvazione: a che punto siamo
Il 31 Ottobre è stata pubblicata la prima bozza 
“definitiva” (DIS)
In votazione fino al 31 Marzo 2012


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 5
Ambito di applicazione
Fasi di lavoro:
Fornisce linee guida per specifiche attività nella 
gestione (handling) delle evidenze digitali.
Da subito definisce le fasi: 
Identificazione
Raccolta (collection)
Acquisizione
"Conservazione" (preservation).


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 6
Ambito di applicazione
La norma non riguarda quindi le fasi di analisi, 
presentazione, eliminazione (disposal).


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 7
Ambito di applicazione
Giurisdizioni
Nessun riferimento a particolari giurisdizioni ma uno 
degli obiettivi è facilitare l'interscambio di evidenze 
(potenziali) tra giurisdizioni diverse.
Applicabile a contesti aziendali e processuali.


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 8
Ambito di applicazione
Tecnico
Esplicito elenco di dispositivi/circostanze/tipologie di 
evidenze a cui si applica: dispositivi di storage ottici e 
magnetici, telefoni, PDA (esistono ancora?) e schede di 
memoria, dispositivi di navigazione, fotocamere e 
videocamere digitali, postazioni di lavoro connesse in rete, 
reti basate su TCP/IP e altri protocolli digitali, sistemi di 
videosorveglianza.


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 9
Definizioni
Digital evidence / evidenze digitali:
 informazioni o dati memorizzati o trasmessi in 
forma binaria su cui si può fare affidamento (may be 
relied upon) come evidenza (mezzi di prova).


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 10
Definizioni
DEFR e DES 
(forse quelle più importanti...)
First responder: persona che è autorizzata, addestrata e 
qualificata ad agire per prima sulla scena (incident scene) 
per eseguire la raccolta e l'acquisizione delle evidenze 
digitali (con la relativa responsabilità). E' prevista 
esplicitamente la possibilità che il DEFR non abbia le tre 
caratteristiche dette: in questo caso altre circostanza 
possono essere considerate, compresa la legge locale 
applicabile.


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 11
Definizioni
DES (Specialist):
 oltre ad essere in grado di assolvere i compiti del 
DEFR, possiede "conoscenza specializzata" per 
gestire una "grande quantità" di tecnologie.

Slide 13
Definizioni
Ripetibilità: proprietà di una procedura condotta per 
ottenere gli stessi risultati sullo stesso ambiente di 
test
Riproducibilità: proprietà di una procedura per 
ottenere gli stessi risultati in un diverso ambiente di 
test (computer, hd, modalità di operazione etc.)
Domanda aperta. come si possono conciliare 
queste definizioni con il C.P.P. Italiano e la prassi?

Slide 14
Overview (principi generali)
●Procedere nella maniera meno intrusiva possibile
●Documentare i metodi applicati in dettaglio, specie 
se risulta necessario modificare le evidenze
●Per quanto praticamente possibile i metodi usati 
devono essere comprensibili e riproducibili da altro 
personale competente

Slide 16
Overview (principi generali)
relevance / rilevanza
Occorre dimostrare che il materiale acquisito è rilevante ai fini 
dell'investigazione, cioè contiene informazioni utili ad assistere 
nell'investigazione, ed è stato giustificabile acquisirlo


www.studioag.pro

Slide 17
Overview (principi generali)
reliability / affidabilità
i processi devono essere verificabili (auditable) e ripetibili 
(repeatable).

Slide 18
Overview (principi generali)
sufficiency / sufficienza
Il DEFR deve assicurare di aver raccolto abbastanza materiale  
per permettere una adeguata investigazione, giustificando 
eventualmente le procedure e le scelte fatte nella raccolta.
Quanto corente con l'ordinamento italiano?
La norma dice che non è sempre necessario per il DEFR 
acquisire tutto il materiale etc.

Slide 19
Overview (principi generali)
Validazione degli strumenti (tool) prima del loro uso
Il concetto di validazione è stato oggetto di molti 
commenti; in quest'ultimo CD è stato ancora 
modificato ma rimane molto poco definito:
- può essere condotta "internamente" o 
"esternamente"
- la documentazione deve essere disponibile (data 
set di test ? procedure ?)

Slide 20
Overview (principi generali)
Passi da compiere per la gestione delle 
evidenze (handling steps) 
In generale va minimizzato l'accesso al dispositivo 
originale, documentato ogni cambiamento e ogni 
azione intrapresa, conformarsi alle norme locali in 
vigore e non effettuare nessuna azione al di là della 
proprie competenze.

Slide 21
Overview (principi generali)
Identificazione
●Ricerca, riconoscimento, documentazione di 
potenziali evidenze sulla scena
●id fisica dei supporti e dei dispositivi
●questa fase include il triage eventuale
●va considerata la volatilità delle potenziali evidenze 
nel definire le priorità e l'ordine di acquisizione
●attenzione alle evidenze "nascoste"


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 22
Overview (principi generali)
Raccolta / Collection
● decisione per l'acquisizione sul posto o la 
“raccolta” del dispositivo
●i dispositivi che possono contenere evidenze 
vengono spostati dalla scena al laboratorio, dopo 
essere stati inventariati, documentati e 
adeguatamente protetti


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 23
Overview (principi generali)
Acquisizione
Questo processo classicamente comporta la 
produzione di un'immagine se possibile identica di 
una potenziale evidenza, sempre documentando e 
giustificando i metodi usati.
I metodi possono variare a seconda della:
● tipologia di supporto o dispositivo
● situazione
● tempi e costi


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 24
Overview (principi generali)
l'originale e la copia devono essere "verificati" e 
originale e copia devono fornire la stessa verifica 
(hash, per esempio)
in alcuni casi questo non è possibile  (settori 
danneggiati, dischi troppo grandi, altre difficoltà) ma 
in ogni caso il metodo va giustificato e documentato


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 25
Overview (principi generali)
Preservation /  Conservazione
● Protezione dell'integrità delle evidenze in ogni 
momento
●Processo che inizia sulla scena e continua in ogni 
momento del ciclo di vita
●Obiettivo: proteggere da spoliation (deterioramento 
non intenzionale) e tampering (modifiche 
intenzionali)
●la confidenzialità delle evidenze deve essere 
assicurata in ogni momento

Slide 27
Overview (principi generali)
Catena di custodia  
"in ogni investigazione il DEFR dovrebbe essere in 
grado di rendere conto di ogni dato e dispositivo 
acquisito in ogni momento durante l'investigazione" 
L'obiettivo sarà raggiunto tipicamente tracciando la 
storia di ogni "item" (oggetto, evidenza) dal 
momento in cui è stato acquisito o raccolto sulla 
scena fino al presente.


www.studioag.pro

Slide 28
Overview (principi generali)
Catena di custodia  (2)
Contenuto minimo dei record:  ID, operatore che ha 
avuto accesso, chi ha prelevato l'evidenza, quando 
e perchè...

Slide 29
Overview (principi generali)
Sicurezza (safety) sulla scena 
 (dell'"incidente", non del crimine...)  
Generale
Controllo dell'area, determinare il referente, allontanare le 
persone presenti se applicabile.
Del personale
la persona investigata è presente?
si può isolare la scena?
ci sono armi?
ci sono macchinari pericolosi, materiali pericolosi?.

Delle evidenze:
● Selezione dei tool e dei dispositivi di acquisizione
● Procedure in caso di danneggiamento delle 
evidenze


www.studioag.pro

Slide 31
Overview (principi generali)
Ruoli e responsabilità, competenze 
DEFR e DES: il DES fornisce conoscenze e skill 
specializzati ai first responder
DEFR e DES devono essere forniti delle minime 
competenze per gestire le evidenze (tecniche e 
anche legali/procedurali), addestrati nella gestione 
di dispositivi digitali che possono contenere 
evidenze, devono mantenere queste conoscenze 
nel tempo.


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 32
Overview (principi generali)
Reasonable care 
● Evitare azioni che possano condurre a 
degradazione delle evidenze
● Opportunità: evitare azioni in alcune condizioni:
● Attenzione alla business continuity
● Dispositivi mission-critical device (ad esempio medicali...)
● Supporti molto grandi 
● Presenza di dati di terze parti non coinvolte


www.studioag.pro

Slide 33
Overview (principi generali)
Documentazione 
● Documentazione di ogni passo compiuto
● Attenzione a timestamp e date
● Documentazione degli schermi e dell'esterno dei 
dispositivi
● Identificazione, numeri di serie e fotografie
● Organizzazione: comunicazione (briefing) dei 
"primi risponditori"
● Prioritizzazione (triage), raccolta e acquisizione
Conservazione

Slide 35
Scenari di applicazione - Computer
Prima scelta:
acquisizione o raccolta ?
poi: dispositivo acceso o spento ?
Questo porta a quattro procedure dettagliate


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 36
Scenari di applicazione - Computer
Procedure per la raccolta (collection)
Dispositivo acceso:
● considerare l'acquisizione logica quando sia sospettabile la 
presenza di dischi o partizioni crittografate
● la configurazione del device determina le procedure di shut 
down: con le procedure normali del SO oppure "staccando la 
spina" (dal dispositivo, non dal muro..)
● etichettare, sconnettere e mettere in sicurezza cavi e porte di 
I/O 
● Inibire fisicamente l'interruttore di accensione
Opzionali: togliere batterie in caso di portatili
Togliere CD/DVD dal drive se presente


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 37
Scenari di applicazione - Computer
Raccolta - Dispositivo spento:
● Sconnettere cavi di alimentazione
● Etichettare, sconnettere e mettere in sicurezza 
cavi e porte di I/O
● Opzionali: se possibile rimuovere i dischi fissi, 
etichettarli e documentarli
● Togliere CD/DVD dal drive se presente


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 38
Scenari di applicazione - Computer
Acquisizione – dispositivo acceso
●Considerare la necessità di acquisire la memoria o 
l'opportunità di non spegnere il dispositivo
●Quindi alternativa: spegnere e acquisire le memorie 
di massa oppure prima effettuare l'acquisizione dei 
dati più “deperibili” (RAM)


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 39
Scenari di applicazione - Computer
Acquisizione – dispositivo spento
●  La procedura consigliata consiste nel 
rimuovere le memorie di massa, e dopo avere 
preparato (eliminato tutti i dati presenti) il disco 
destinazione, creare una copia (imaging)

"Dispositivi connessi in rete" (Networked devices)
Procedure e definizioni non completamente 
formalizzate come la precedente e anche un po' 
confusa nell'esposizione.

Slide 41
Scenari di applicazione – dispositivi in rete
Definizione di "networked devices": 
"computer o altri dispositivi digitali che sono 
connessi ad una rete cablata o senza fili. Possono 
includere mainframe, server, desktop, access point, 
switch, hub, router, dispositivi mobili, PDA, sistemi 
CCTV e molti altri..:" 
Definizione vaga se mai ce n'è una...

Slide 42
Scenari di applicazione – dispositivi in rete
Identificazione
Raccomandazioni specifiche per identificare i 
dispositivi: possono essere utili le caratteristiche 
fisiche, eventuali interfacce proprietarie, etichette 
presenti (IMEI), il reverse lookup del numero 
telefonico (per definire l'operatore di rete).


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 43
Scenari di applicazione – dispositivi in rete
● Ricerca sulla scena e documentazione
● Registrare tipo, marca, modello, numero di serie di ogni 
dispositivo ( e degli oggetti associati: SIM, alimentatori, 
confezioni etc)
● Per i dispositivi tipo server che forniscono servizi di rete: 
identificare se possibile i servizi -> definire il livello di criticità e 
la conseguenze in caso di disconnessione della rete
● CCTV: annotare numero/tipo delle videocamere e quali 
stanno registrando; tipo e configurazione del videoserver.

Slide 44
Scenari di applicazione – dispositivi in rete
Raccolta, acquisizione e conservazione
Generale - aspetti da considerare:
i dispositivi possono avere molti modi di 
connessione:  RF, Blootooth, IR, Touch screen
varietà di sistemi operativi e quindi di modalità di 
acquisizione
non introdurre dispositivi wireless sulla scena


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 45
Scenari di applicazione – dispositivi in rete
Collection
E' raccomandato isolare il dispositivo della rete (in 
accordo con le leggi vigenti).
Documentare tutti le connessioni
Se la collection precede l'acquisizione il dispositivo 
deve essere mantenuto alimentato...


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 46
Scenari di applicazione – dispositivi in rete
Acquisizione
● Prima di sconnettere il dispositivo della rete, 
effettuare l'acquisizione logica
●Tenere conto della possibilità di connessioni 
multiple
●Isolamento dalla rete: (jammer, area di lavoro 
schermata, use delle (U)SIM forensi)


www.studioag.pro
www.studioag.eu
Slide 47
Scenari di applicazione 
Sistemi di videosorveglianza 
(Ancora definiti CCTV)
● Determinare se la sequenza di interesse è stata 
effettivamente registrata
● Determinare la/le videocamere interessate
● Verificare i timestamp delle immagini
● Opzioni possibili:
●acquisire i file video copiandoli su DVD/BR
●acquisire i file su un disco esterno
●acquisire via rete
●(extrema ratio): acquisire utilizzando le opzioni del sistema 
(esportazione MP4 etc). E' probabile che i file vengano 
compressi e si perdano informazioni.

Commenti italiani e criticità
Ultimo meeting 
 Il paragrafo sulle procedure per l'acquisizione dei 
dispositivi in rete troppo ampio → chiesta la 
separazione del “mobile forensics”


www.studioag.pro

Slide 49
Commenti italiani e criticità
Ultimo meeting
Molte modifiche editoriali → eliminata la parola 
“triage” e sostituita con “prioritization”
Criticità
Non copre l'analisi (ci sono comunque degli item 
proposti dagli inglesi)
